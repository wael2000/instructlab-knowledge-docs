## Preface
This report is the conclusion of a TZ assignment that was carried out in the months January to May of the year 1996. In March 1997, a number of changes were made on the basis of new insights that strongly influenced the results. In the preceding internship period, which was completed at the Rijkswaterstaat Construction Department, some aspects of bridge design were already introduced. In the following graduation period, the design of a fully fibre-reinforced plastic bridge will be further discussed. I would like to thank ir. SEE de Winter and Mr. D. Ros
in particular for their help and advice in the past period.

## Summary

The maintenance costs of steel bridges are a major expense.
Rijkswaterstaat is therefore looking for materials that require less maintenance, such as fibre-
reinforced plastics.

Therefore, as part of a TZ and graduation assignment, a study is being carried out into the technical aspects and consequences of designing, producing, maintaining and repairing a fibre-reinforced plastic bridge.

The aim of this TZ assignment was to make a structural design of the bridge of a load class 60 drawbridge with associated details, such as the pivot points of the bridge, the supports of the bridge, the suspension rod-bridge connection and the rack-rod-bridge connection. The studied bridge has a
bridge length of 16 meters and a width of 12.5 meters. Half of the bridge is taken up by traffic lanes
and half by footpaths and cycle paths.

Only analytical calculations were performed (it is therefore recommended to perform finite element calculations at a later stage), whereby costs were optimized and in the second instance the aim was to achieve the lowest possible weight. The aim for the lowest possible weight of the fall stems from the fact that by making the fall lighter, the superstructure can also be made lighter and cheaper (the snowball
effect). The calculations were made using, among other things, the netting theory.

After a program of requirements was drawn up, a number of construction forms of the bridge were studied, of which two were selected. The first construction form is a girder-web plate construction with decoupled longitudinal and transverse stiffness, in which the transverse stiffness is provided by the road surface {"multi-girder construction"). The second construction form is a sandwich construction, in which longitudinal and transverse stiffness are integrated. For both constructions, the total construction height is 1 meter and both constructions are supported on the substructure over the entire width. These two constructions are compared on the basis of costs, with the requirements regarding
inspectability, maintenance, etc. in the background.

## THE MULTI-GIRDER CONSTRUCTION
A double sandwich construction and a box-shaped road surface were studied as a road surface for this construction type. In the double sandwich construction, PE/PUR is used for the upper sandwich core and PVC foam is used for the lower sandwich core. UD GFRP is used for the facings of the sandwich construction. The box-shaped road surface is constructed from 0-90° GFRP fabrics for reasons of manufacturability. The double sandwich construction appears to be structurally feasible, but due to the low shear stiffness of the cores, a large part of the deflection is determined by shear, which leads to relatively thick facings. Based on costs and weights, the author prefers to use a box-shaped road surface. However, this box-shaped road surface still requires a constructed from 0-90° GFRP fabrics. The double sandwich construction appears to be
structurally feasible, but due to the low shear stiffness of the cores, a large part of the deflection is determined by shear, which leads to relatively thick facings.

The box-shaped road surface results in a weight of 6936 kg at // € 159,424 in costs (with a web spacing of 750 mm for traffic lanes and footpaths and cycle paths together).

The design of the main structure of the lanes is stiffness dominated. Applying the same stiffness requirement as for a steel design (1/600 part of the length) would negate many of the advantages of fibre reinforced plastics. Based on designs of composite floors, an allowable deflection of the composite structure of 1/250 part of the length is used. The lightest and most cost-effective construction can be obtained by using GFRP web plates in combination with CFRP purlins. whereby an epoxy (or vinylester) is used as matrix material.

For the main construction of the footpaths and cycle paths, a strength design is made for the exceptional case that a 30-ton truck drives over these paths. Here too, the same material combination is used as for the web plates.

At the location of the suspension rods and rack rods it is necessary to apply cross ties/ribs because otherwise the transverse stiffness of the bridge is insufficient. Also based on the traffic load the transverse stiffness appears to be insufficient and the application of cross ties is necessary. In connection with the necessity to apply cross ties the author prefers a larger web plate distance of 750 mm (because this leads to fewer crossings of longitudinal and transverse ties and because the weights and costs for both web plate distances are almost identical). The total costs of the multi-girder construction amount to // 528,806,- with a weight of 16,798 kg.

The multi-girder construction can be produced using either hand lamination or Resin Transfer
Moulding (RTM).

In closed form the multi-girder construction cannot be produced, but the construction can
best be executed as a road surface on which hat-shaped main girders are glued. If hand
lamination is used, the fall can in principle be produced in one piece and if RTM is
used, the construction can best be divided into separately produced hat profiles.

## THE SANDWICH CONSTRUCTION
For the sandwich construction, the second construction form, polystyrene foam is used as a sandwich core, since both the costs and the density of this are relatively low.

However, a layer of PVC foam is applied above the polystyrene and above that a layer of PE or PUR to spread the pressure load. The weight of this "road surface" comes to approximately 12,740 kg and the costs come to approximately fl 159,843.

The weight of this "road surface" comes to approximately 12,740 kg and the costs come to approximately fl 159,843.

For the main construction, the same material combination is used as for the multi-girder construction. In this construction form, the web plates are spaced 1500 mm apart. It is assumed that the load of the wheels is transferred to the web plates via the foam, so that the foam does not carry the entire load of a truck, but only the load of a single wheel. The weight of the entire main construction comes to 20982 kg and the costs come
to ft 452,679,-.

Comparison of the multi-girder construction and the sandwich construction shows that the second is slightly cheaper than the first (fl 76,127), but is 4184 kg heavier. In connection with maintenance and inspectability, the author prefers the multi-girder construction. Compared to an equal fall in steel, this means a cost saving of fl 101,194 and a weight saving of 35702 kg (however, no additional costs and weights of technical details are included). The total costs and weight savings will probably be even higher because the superstructure can also be made lighter due to the lighter fall.

After studying the main construction, a number of technical details were studied, the conclusions of which are given here. The aim is to have a support over the entire width of the fall. For the construction of these supports, the author prefers to glue a stainless steel strip under the end ribs and a UHMWPE support surface on the quay.

Gluing steel fittings to the structure also appears to be possible, but results in a larger number of connections.

Since the aim is to have a support over the entire width of the bridge, the pivot points of the bridge must also be designed in such a way that this is possible. Pivot points are therefore chosen that are relieved when the bridge comes down because the support under the bridge touches the support surface on the quay.

For the time being, two pivot points with a mortise and tenon joint are chosen, possibly in combination with the use of steel gusset plates. The required laminate thicknesses resulting from the loads are acceptable.

For the suspension rods and rack rods, if they are attached to side beams (for the description of side beams see below), a symmetrical construction is chosen using a mortise and tenon joint. However, if they are attached directly to the halyard, an asymmetrical construction is preferred, in which an axis is fitted through several web plates of the halyard. Both methods lead to acceptable laminate thicknesses and
can possibly be used in combination with steel gusset plates.

However, if they are attached directly to the halyard, an asymmetrical construction is preferred in which an axis is applied through several web plates of the halyard. Both methods lead to acceptable laminate thicknesses and can possibly
be used in combination with steel gusset plates Since stiffness rather than strength is the determining factor when designing in fibre-reinforced plastics, it seems advantageous for the design of the balance prongs to make them shorter than in a conventional design in steel. However, this also shifts the connection point of the suspension rods to the halyard, which may cause vibration problems. These vibration problems can be solved by installing side beams next to the halyard to which the suspension rods are attached. These side beams are only connected to the halyard at the location of the supports. The attachment of the side beams to the halyard (if used) must be rotatable. A connection is chosen in
which an axis passes through both web plates of the side beams and also through several web plates of the halyard. The magnitude of the load appears to be such that this solution is indeed quite possible. 

Finally, it can be concluded that designing a fully fibre-reinforced plastic trap is
indeed structurally possible and also cost-effective.


## 1. Introduction
The maintenance costs of steel bridges are a major expense.

Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) is therefore looking for less maintenance-sensitive materials such as fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs). Therefore, in the context of a TZen graduation assignment, a study is being conducted into the technical aspects and consequences of designing, producing, maintaining and repairing a fibre-reinforced plastic bridge.

This report contains the reporting of a TZ assignment, the aim of which was to make a structural design of the bridgehead of a load class 60 drawbridge with associated details, such as the pivot points of the bridgehead, bridgehead supports, the suspension rod-bridgehead connection and the rack-rod-bridgehead connection (figure 1.1 shows a drawbridge with the names of some bridge components). The bridgehead studied has a length of 16 m and a width of 12.5 m. Half of the bridgehead is taken up by traffic lanes and half by footpaths and cycle paths.

Only analytical calculations will be performed, whereby the first step will be to optimize costs and the second step will be to strive for the lowest possible weight. The pursuit of the lowest possible weight of the fall stems from the fact that by making the fall lighter, the superstructure can also be made lighter and cheaper (the snowball effect). The calculations were made using, among other things, the netting theory. The figures included in this report are all principle sketches.

The structure of the report is as follows. After the introduction of Chapter 1, Chapter 2 discusses why a fibre-reinforced plastic construction is being pursued. Chapter 3 sets out a programme of requirements. Chapter 4 then discusses a number of structural solutions for the fall, examining the manner in which longitudinal and transverse stiffness of the fall is obtained. Of the construction forms discussed in Chapter 4, two are selected and then studied in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. These two chapters discuss both the main construction and the road surface. Chapter 7 studies a number of structural details of the fall. Finally, Chapter 8 provides conclusions and recommendations.

Appendix A discusses the programme of requirements in more detail and Appendix B derives a number of buckling formulas based on netting theory. selected which are then studied in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. These two chapters discuss both the main structure and the road surface. In Chapter 7, a number of constructional details of the fall are studied. 

Finally, in Chapter 8, the conclusions and recommendations are given. Appendix A discusses the programme of
requirements in more detail and in Appendix B, a number of buckling formulas are derived based on the netting
theory.

## 2. Why fiber reinforced plastics?
The main reason for RWS to use fibre reinforced plastics is to reduce maintenance costs. 

The underlying goal here is to minimise the total design, construction, management and cycle costs in the long term and to build sustainably in this way. It is these integral costs that make the use of FRP's can be made economically responsible.

By using FRPs a lighter construction can be obtained, which is reinforced by the "snowball effect". This snowball effect means that by making a certain part of the construction lighter, other parts can also be made lighter and therefore cheaper. For example, by making the fall lighter, the counterweights, balances, hamei styles and foundation can also be made lighter. By constructing integrally in this way, the advantages of FRP can be fully utilised.

Although the purchase price of a fiber reinforced plastic bridge may be higher than that of a steel-concrete bridge, profits can be achieved over time due to the significant reduction in maintenance costs. In other words, it is expected that over the entire lifespan, the COST EFFECTIVENESS of fiber reinforced plastic constructions can also be greater than that of other construction types for bridges.

Designing a fiber reinforced plastic bridge is not a completely new subject, for example in England there are already two completely fiber reinforced plastic bridges. Both bridges are produced according to the Advanced Composite Construction System, using pultrusion profiles. These two bridges are shown in the appendices.

## 3. Program of requirements
This section lists the requirements that can be imposed on bridge structures. The bridge studied is a load class 60 drawbridge with a drop length of 16 metres and a width of 12.5 metres, with half of the drop taken up by footpaths and cycle paths and half by traffic lanes. Although the traffic lanes are designed for load class 60, the cycle paths are designed for a lower load class, class 30. The requirements for strength and loads are
detailed in Appendix A. A standard load class 60 lorry according to VOSB 1963 (Lit.5) is shown in Figure 3.1 (a class 30 lorry has three axles with two wheels per axle, so an equal wheel load).metres and a width of 12.5 metres, with half of the area taken up by footpaths and cycle paths and
half by traffic lanes. While the traffic lanes are designed for load class 60, the cycle paths are designed for a lower load class, class 30. The requirements for strength and loads are detailed in Appendix A. A standard load class 60 lorry according to VOSB 1963 (Lit.5) is shown in Figure 3.1 (a class 30 lorry has three axles with two wheels per axle, so an equal wheel load).

## Mechanical:
- · courage:
The strength and load requirements are discussed in Appendix A.
- · stiffness:
For steel bridges, the guideline (i.e. no fixed requirement) is 1/600 of the length of the bridge. If a similar guideline were to be used for fibre-reinforced plastics, this would probably not lead to a cost-effective construction. A lower deflection requirement is therefore used, a requirement that arises from the design of fibre-reinforced plastic floors, 1/250 of the length. This deflection requirement results in a maximum permissible
deflection of 64 mm.

## Durability / Maintenance:
- · The bridge must be fatigue resistant.
- · Corrosion resistant.
- · Material degradation by the environment should be as low as possible.
- · Good impact properties.
- · Wear resistance of the road surface.

- · Crawl should be predictable and controllable.
- · The bridge must be resistant to lightning strikes.
- · Maximum accessibility for inspection, repair and maintenance.
- The bridge must be maintenance-free for a period of 25 years.

## Physical / Chemical:
- · Stresses and deformations due to thermal expansion must not be harmful or impede bridge operation.
- · Nor may damage occur due to freezing of water in seams and the like.
- · There are no actual fire regulations, but it must be demonstrated that the fibres are not affected within a certain period of time (say 30 minutes). In addition, no (too much) toxic material may be released in the event of fire.

- · There are no actual fire regulations, but it must be demonstrated that the fibres are not affected within a certain period of time (say 30 minutes). In addition, no (too much) toxic material may be released in the event of fire.

## Technological:
- · Good manufacturability at the lowest possible costs.
- · A simple and therefore fast and cheap assembly should be pursued.
- · The components for assembly must be easily transportable. Is it possible to assemble almost completely in the factory and then transport them, or can more profit be achieved by assembling them on site?
- · Repairability must be at least as simple as with a steel bridge.

## Safety Requirements:
- · It goes without saying that the bridge must meet the specified safety requirements, which will not be further elaborated here.
## Business security requirements:
- · The time period that the bridge must be able to fulfil must be determined with the greatest possible certainty.
## Requirements from the environment:
- · The desired colour and the like must be possible to realise during production.
## Technical detail requirements:
- The bridge must be equipped with instruments for monitoring the behaviour of the structural parts under the influence of weight, loads, fatigue, vibrations and temperature influences.
## Costs:
- · The total costs (over the entire life cycle) must be as low as possible.
- Other: Specific requirements regarding details such as bearings and drive, which are stated here

## 4. Construction forms of the trap.
## 4.1 Introduction
In this chapter, some constructive possibilities for the fall will be discussed. Attention will be focused on constructions that can be produced using hand lamination or Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM). It is expected that using these methods a greater efficiency can be achieved than using e.g. pultruding When considering the construction possibilities, particular attention is paid to the manner in which both
longitudinal and transverse stiffness are obtained. The longitudinal direction here refers to the lengthwise direction of the bridge and the transverse direction refers to the widthwise direction of the bridge.

## 4.2 Construction shapes and transverse stiffness of the fall.
In order to form an integral structure, the beam must have longitudinal stiffness as well as transverse stiffness. This transverse stiffness can be obtained in various ways. In this section, a number of construction forms are discussed that are shown in figure 4.1:

- 1. In this construction form, longitudinal and transverse stiffness are decoupled, with the longitudinal stiffness being provided by main girders and the transverse stiffness being provided by the road surface. The maximum permissible height of the road surface largely determines the maximum
transverse stiffness.
- 2. If the transverse stiffness that the road surface can provide is insufficient at the first construction possibility, then crossbeams/ribs can be used to obtain sufficient transverse stiffness. The application of crossbeams/ribs is also probably necessary at the location of suspension rod and rack-and-drop connections.
- 3. Instead of decoupling longitudinal and transverse stiffness, these can also be integrated. One possibility for this is, for example, a truss construction that is built up from plates instead of bars as is usual for trusses. In one direction, the construction functions as a girder web construction and in the direction perpendicular to this, as a truss construction. In the truss shown here, the plates extend over the width of the
bridge. The road surface, like the upper girder, must have its greatest stiffness in the longitudinal direction, so that these parts can be well integrated.
- 4. The construction shown here is also a truss construction, in which case the plates extend over the length of the bridge. In the longitudinal direction the construction functions as a girder-web plate construction and in the transverse direction as a truss construction.

- 5. Another construction form with integrated longitudinal and transverse stiffness is a full sandwich construction. The sandwich construction shown here uses a continuous medium as sandwich core. The most advantages are to use a foam construction in combination with a number of web plates. The load due to a wheel is conducted transversely to the web plates, so that the foam does not conduct the
entire weight of the trucks.

- 6. The construction shown here is also a sandwich construction with integrated longitudinal and transverse stiffness. Instead of a continuous medium, a honeycomb construction is used here.

- 7. Instead of conducting the wheel load in the width direction to the web plates, in this construction the load in the longitudinal direction of the bridge is conducted by a stiffened road surface to the cross girders/ribs. These cross girders/ribs are connected to the longitudinal girders and provide the required transverse stiffness.

## 4.3 Comparison of the construction forms
The first construction form provides great advantages due to a small number of crossings of the different components, the disadvantage is however the small construction height for achieving sufficient transverse stiffness. The application of cross members/ribs leads to a strong increase in transverse stiffness, but also leads to a strong increase in production costs. 

Both truss constructions are effective because they integrate longitudinal and transverse stiffness. 

Problems arise with these trusses when designing the intersections of the plates, especially when sandwich plates are used, and the transfer of stresses from the web plates to the purlins. Another problem with these truss constructions is the application of pivots and connections.
The sandwich constructions are also effective because longitudinal and transverse stiffness are integrated.

A disadvantage of the construction with a continuous medium as sandwich core is possibly the large volume of foam (or other solid material) that is required. A disadvantage of the honeycomb construction is the complicated production and the transfer of stresses from the web plates to the purlins.

In the last (seventh) construction form, a large number of intersections of the different components occur. This construction is clearly not effectively produced with fibre-reinforced plastics.

In the following chapters two constructions will be studied, one with integrated and one with decoupled longitudinal and transverse stiffness. Based on the above considerations the first construction form is chosen, which changes into the second if the road surface does not provide sufficient stiffness, and the fifth construction form is chosen. The first construction form will be referred to as the "multi-girder construction"
and the fifth construction form as the "sandwich construction".
