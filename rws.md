## Preface
This report is the conclusion of a TZ assignment that was carried out in the months January to
May of the year 1996. In March 1997, a number of changes were made on the basis of new
insights that strongly influenced the results. In the preceding internship period, which was
completed at the Rijkswaterstaat Construction Department, some aspects of bridge design were
already introduced. In the following graduation period, the design of a fully fibre-reinforced
plastic bridge will be further discussed. I would like to thank ir. SEE de Winter and Mr. D. Ros
in particular for their help and advice in the past period.

## Summary

The maintenance costs of steel bridges are a major expense.
Rijkswaterstaat is therefore looking for materials that require less maintenance, such as fibre-
reinforced plastics.
Therefore, as part of a TZ and graduation assignment, a study is being carried out into the technical aspects
and consequences of designing, producing, maintaining and repairing a fibre-reinforced plastic bridge.
The aim of this TZ assignment was to make a structural design of the bridge of a load class 60 drawbridge with
associated details, such as the pivot points of the bridge, the supports of the bridge, the
suspension rod-bridge connection and the rack-rod-bridge connection. The studied bridge has a
bridge length of 16 meters and a width of 12.5 meters. Half of the bridge is taken up by traffic lanes
and half by footpaths and cycle paths.
Only analytical calculations were performed (it is therefore recommended to perform finite element
calculations at a later stage), whereby costs were optimized and in the second instance the aim was
to achieve the lowest possible weight. The aim for the lowest possible weight of the fall stems from the fact
that by making the fall lighter, the superstructure can also be made lighter and cheaper (the snowball
effect). The calculations were made using, among other things, the netting theory.
After a program of requirements was drawn up, a number of construction forms of the bridge were studied, of
which two were selected. The first construction form is a girder-web plate construction with decoupled
longitudinal and transverse stiffness, in which the transverse stiffness is provided by the road surface
{"multi-girder construction"). The second construction form is a sandwich construction, in which longitudinal
and transverse stiffness are integrated. For both constructions, the total construction height is 1
meter and both constructions are supported on the substructure over the entire
width. These two constructions are compared on the basis of costs, with the requirements regarding
inspectability, maintenance, etc. in the background.
## THE MULTI-GIRDER CONSTRUCTION
A double sandwich construction and a box-shaped road surface were studied as a road
surface for this construction type. In the double sandwich construction, PE/PUR is used for the upper sandwich
core and PVC foam is used for the lower sandwich core. UD GFRP is used for the facings of the sandwich
construction. The box-shaped road surface is constructed from 0-90° GFRP fabrics for reasons of
manufacturability. The double sandwich construction appears to be structurally feasible, but
due to the low shear stiffness of the cores, a large part of the deflection is determined by shear, which
leads to relatively thick facings. Based on costs and weights, the author prefers to use a box-shaped
road surface. However, this box-shaped road surface still requires a

constructed from 0-90° GFRP fabrics. The double sandwich construction appears to be
structurally feasible, but due to the low shear stiffness of the cores, a large
part of the deflection is determined by shear, which leads to relatively thick facings.
Based on costs and weights, the author prefers to use a box-shaped road surface. However,
with this box-shaped road surface, a
<!-- image -->
the right solution can be found for absorbing braking forces.
The box-shaped road surface results in a weight of 6936 kg at // € 159,424 in costs (with
a web spacing of 750 mm for traffic lanes and footpaths and cycle paths together).
The design of the main structure of the lanes is stiffness dominated. Applying the same
stiffness requirement as for a steel design (1/600 part of the length) would negate many of the
advantages of fibre reinforced plastics. Based on designs of composite floors, an
allowable deflection of the composite structure of 1/250 part of the length is used. The
lightest and most cost-effective construction can be obtained by using GFRP web plates in
combination with CFRP purlins. whereby an epoxy (or vinylester) is used as matrix material.
For the main construction of the footpaths and cycle paths, a strength design is made
for the exceptional case that a 30-ton truck drives over these paths. Here too, the same material
combination is used as for the web plates.
At the location of the suspension rods and rack rods it is necessary to apply cross ties/ribs
because otherwise the transverse stiffness of the bridge is insufficient. Also based on the
traffic load the transverse stiffness appears to be insufficient and the application of cross ties is
necessary. In connection with the necessity to apply cross ties the author prefers a
larger web plate distance of 750 mm (because this leads to fewer crossings of
longitudinal and transverse ties and because the weights and costs for both web plate
distances are almost identical). The total costs of the multi-girder construction amount
to // 528,806,- with a weight of 16,798 kg.
The multi-girder construction can be produced using either hand lamination or Resin Transfer
Moulding (RTM).
In closed form the multi-girder construction cannot be produced, but the construction can
best be executed as a road surface on which hat-shaped main girders are glued. If hand
lamination is used, the fall can in principle be produced in one piece and if RTM is
used, the construction can best be divided into separately produced hat profiles.
## THE SANDWICH CONSTRUCTION
For the sandwich construction, the second construction form, polystyrene foam is
used as a sandwich core, since both the costs and the density of this are relatively low.
However, a layer of PVC foam is applied above the polystyrene and above that a layer of PE
or PUR to spread the pressure load. The weight of this "road surface" comes to approximately
12,740 kg and the costs come to approximately fl 159,843.

"road surface" comes to approximately 12,740 kg and the costs come to approximately fl 159,843.
For the main construction, the same material combination is used as for the multi-girder construction. In this
construction form, the web plates are spaced 1500 mm apart. It is assumed that the load of the wheels is
transferred to the web plates via the foam, so that the foam does not carry the entire load of a truck, but only
the load of a single wheel. The weight of the entire main construction comes to 20982 kg and the costs come
to ft 452,679,-.
<!-- image -->
Comparison of the multi-girder construction and the sandwich construction shows
that the second is slightly cheaper than the first (fl 76,127), but is 4184 kg heavier. In connection with
maintenance and inspectability, the author prefers the multi-girder construction. Compared to an equal fall in
steel, this means a cost saving of fl 101,194 and a weight saving of 35702 kg (however, no additional costs
and weights of technical details are included). The total costs and weight savings will probably be even higher
because the superstructure can also be made lighter due to the lighter fall.
After studying the main construction, a number of technical details were studied, the conclusions
of which are given here. The aim is to have a support over the entire width of the fall. For the construction
of these supports, the author prefers to glue a stainless steel strip under the end ribs and a UHMWPE
support surface on the quay.
Gluing steel fittings to the structure also appears to be possible, but results in a larger number of
connections.
Since the aim is to have a support over the entire width of the bridge, the pivot points of the bridge must also be
designed in such a way that this is possible. Pivot points are therefore chosen that are relieved when the
bridge comes down because the support under the bridge touches the support surface on the quay.
For the time being, two pivot points with a mortise and tenon joint are chosen, possibly in combination with
the use of steel gusset plates. The required laminate thicknesses resulting from the loads are acceptable.
For the suspension rods and rack rods, if they are attached to side beams (for the description of side
beams see below), a symmetrical construction is chosen using a mortise and tenon joint. However, if they
are attached directly to the halyard, an asymmetrical construction is preferred, in which an axis is fitted through
several web plates of the halyard. Both methods lead to acceptable laminate thicknesses and
can possibly be used in combination with steel gusset plates.

However, if they are attached directly to the halyard, an asymmetrical
construction is preferred in which an axis is applied through several web plates of the
halyard. Both methods lead to acceptable laminate thicknesses and can possibly
be used in combination with steel gusset plates
Since stiffness rather than strength is the determining factor when designing in
fibre-reinforced plastics, it seems advantageous for the design of the balance
prongs to make them shorter than in a conventional design in steel. However, this
also shifts the connection point of the suspension rods to the halyard, which
may cause vibration problems. These vibration problems can be solved by installing
side beams next to the halyard to which the suspension rods are attached. These side
beams are only connected to the halyard at the location of the supports. The attachment
of the side beams to the halyard (if used) must be rotatable. A connection is chosen in
which an axis passes through both web plates of the side beams and also through
several web plates of the halyard. The magnitude of the load appears to be such
that this solution is indeed quite possible.
Finally, it can be concluded that designing a fully fibre-reinforced plastic trap is
indeed structurally possible and also cost-effective.

## 1. Introduction
The maintenance costs of steel bridges are a major expense.
Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) is therefore looking for less maintenance-sensitive materials
such as fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs). Therefore, in the context of a TZen graduation
assignment, a study is being conducted into the technical aspects and consequences of
designing, producing, maintaining and repairing a fibre-reinforced plastic bridge.
This report contains the reporting of a TZ assignment, the aim of which was to make a
structural design of the bridgehead of a load class 60 drawbridge with associated details,
such as the pivot points of the bridgehead, bridgehead supports, the suspension rod-
bridgehead connection and the rack-rod-bridgehead connection (figure 1.1 shows a
drawbridge with the names of some bridge components). The bridgehead studied has a
length of 16 m and a width of 12.5 m. Half of the bridgehead is taken up by
traffic lanes and half by footpaths and cycle paths.
Only analytical calculations will be performed, whereby the first step will be to optimize costs and the second step
will be to strive for the lowest possible weight. The pursuit of the lowest possible weight of the fall stems from
the fact that by making the fall lighter, the superstructure can also be made lighter and cheaper (the
snowball effect). The calculations were made using, among other things, the netting theory. The figures
included in this report are all principle sketches.
The structure of the report is as follows. After the introduction of Chapter 1, Chapter 2 discusses
why a fibre-reinforced plastic construction is being pursued. Chapter 3 sets out a programme of
requirements. Chapter 4 then discusses a number of structural solutions for the fall, examining the manner in
which longitudinal and transverse stiffness of the fall is obtained. Of the construction forms discussed in
Chapter 4, two are selected and then studied in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. These two chapters
discuss both the main construction and the road surface. Chapter 7 studies a number of structural
details of the fall. Finally, Chapter 8 provides conclusions and recommendations.
Appendix A discusses the programme of requirements in more detail and Appendix B derives a
number of buckling formulas based on netting theory.

selected which are then studied in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. These two chapters discuss both the
main structure and the road surface. In Chapter 7, a number of constructional details of the fall are studied.
Finally, in Chapter 8, the conclusions and recommendations are given. Appendix A discusses the programme of
requirements in more detail and in Appendix B, a number of buckling formulas are derived based on the netting
theory.

## 2. Why fiber reinforced plastics?
The main reason for RWS to use fibre reinforced plastics is to reduce maintenance costs.
The underlying goal here is to minimise the total design, construction, management and cycle
costs in the long term and to build sustainably in this way. It is these integral costs that make the use of
FRP
'
s can be made economically responsible.
By using FRPs a lighter construction can be obtained, which is reinforced by the "snowball effect". This
snowball effect means that by making a certain part of the construction lighter, other parts can also be made
lighter and therefore cheaper. For example, by making the fall lighter, the counterweights, balances, hamei
styles and foundation can also be made lighter. By constructing integrally in this way, the advantages of
FRP can be fully utilised.
'
s
Although the purchase price of a fiber reinforced plastic bridge may be higher than that of a steel-concrete
bridge, profits can be achieved over time due to the significant reduction in maintenance costs. In other
words, it is expected that over the entire lifespan, the COST EFFECTIVENESS of fiber reinforced plastic
constructions can also be greater than that of other construction types for bridges.
Designing a fiber reinforced plastic bridge is not a completely new subject, for example in England there are
already two completely fiber reinforced plastic bridges. Both bridges are produced according
to the Advanced Composite Construction System, using pultrusion profiles. These two bridges are
shown in the appendices.

## 3. Program of requirements
This section lists the requirements that can be imposed on bridge structures. The bridge studied is a load class
60 drawbridge with a drop length of 16 metres and a width of 12.5 metres, with half of the drop taken up by
footpaths and cycle paths and half by traffic lanes. Although the traffic lanes are designed for load class 60,
the cycle paths are designed for a lower load class, class 30. The requirements for strength and loads are
detailed in Appendix A. A standard load class 60 lorry according to VOSB 1963 (Lit.5) is shown in Figure 3.1
(a class 30 lorry has three axles with two wheels per axle, so an equal wheel load).

metres and a width of 12.5 metres, with half of the area taken up by footpaths and cycle paths and
half by traffic lanes. While the traffic lanes are designed for load class 60, the cycle paths are
designed for a lower load class, class 30. The requirements for strength and
loads are detailed in Appendix A. A standard load class 60 lorry according to VOSB 1963 (Lit.5) is
shown in Figure 3.1 (a class 30 lorry has three axles with two wheels per axle, so an equal wheel
load).

## Mechanical:
- · courage:
The strength and load requirements are discussed in Appendix A.
- · stiffness:
For steel bridges, the guideline (i.e. no fixed requirement) is 1/600 of the length of the bridge. If a similar guideline
were to be used for fibre-reinforced plastics, this would probably not lead to a cost-effective
construction. A lower deflection requirement is therefore used, a requirement that arises from the design of fibre-
reinforced plastic floors, 1/250 of the length. This deflection requirement results in a maximum permissible
deflection of 64 mm.
## Durability / Maintenance:
- · The bridge must be fatigue resistant.
- · Corrosion resistant.
- · Material degradation by the environment should be as low as possible.
- · Good impact properties.
- · Wear resistance of the road surface.
<!-- image -->
- · Crawl should be predictable and controllable.
- · The bridge must be resistant to lightning strikes.
- · Maximum accessibility for inspection, repair and maintenance.
- The bridge must be maintenance-free for a period of 25 years.
## Physical / Chemical:
- · Stresses and deformations due to thermal expansion must not be harmful or impede bridge
operation.
- · Nor may damage occur due to freezing of water in seams and the like.
- · There are no actual fire regulations, but it must be demonstrated that the fibres are not affected
within a certain period of time (say 30 minutes). In addition, no (too much) toxic material may be
released in the event of fire.

- · There are no actual fire regulations, but it must be demonstrated that the fibres are not affected within a
certain period of time (say 30 minutes). In addition, no (too much) toxic material may be released in the event
of fire.
## Technological:
- · Good manufacturability at the lowest possible costs.
- · A simple and therefore fast and cheap assembly should be pursued.
- · The components for assembly must be easily transportable. Is it possible to assemble almost completely in
the factory and then transport them, or can more profit be achieved by assembling them on site?
- · Repairability must be at least as simple as with a steel bridge.
## Safety Requirements:
- · It goes without saying that the bridge must meet the specified safety requirements, which
will not be further elaborated here.
## Business security requirements:
- · The time period that the bridge must be able to fulfil must be determined with the greatest possible certainty.
## Requirements from the environment:
- · The desired colour and the like must be possible to realise during production.
## Technical detail requirements:
- The bridge must be equipped with instruments for monitoring the behaviour of the structural parts under the
influence of weight, loads, fatigue, vibrations and temperature influences.
## Costs:
- · The total costs (over the entire life cycle) must be as low as possible.
- Other: Specific requirements regarding details such as bearings and drive, which are stated here

## 4. Construction forms of the trap.
## 4.1 Introduction

In this chapter, some constructive possibilities for the fall will be discussed. Attention will be focused on
constructions that can be produced using hand lamination or Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM). It is
expected that using these methods a greater efficiency can be achieved than using e.g. pultruding
When considering the construction possibilities, particular attention is paid to the manner in which both
longitudinal and transverse stiffness are obtained. The longitudinal direction here refers to the lengthwise
direction of the bridge and the transverse direction refers to the widthwise direction of the bridge.
## 4.2 Construction shapes and transverse stiffness of the fall.
In order to form an integral structure, the beam must have longitudinal stiffness as well as
transverse stiffness. This transverse stiffness can be obtained in various ways. In this section, a number
of construction forms are discussed that are shown in figure 4.1:
- 1. In this construction form, longitudinal and transverse stiffness are decoupled, with the longitudinal
stiffness being provided by main girders and the transverse stiffness being provided by the
road surface. The maximum permissible height of the road surface largely determines the maximum
transverse stiffness.
- 2. If the transverse stiffness that the road surface can provide is insufficient at the first construction possibility,
then crossbeams/ribs can be used to obtain sufficient transverse stiffness. The application of crossbeams/
ribs is also probably necessary at the location of suspension rod and rack-and-drop connections.
- 3. Instead of decoupling longitudinal and transverse stiffness, these can also be integrated. One possibility for
this is, for example, a truss construction that is built up from plates instead of bars as is usual for
trusses. In one direction, the construction functions as a girder web construction and in the direction
perpendicular to this, as a truss construction. In the truss shown here, the plates extend over the width of the
bridge. The road surface, like the upper girder, must have its greatest stiffness in the longitudinal direction, so
that these parts can be well integrated.
- 4. The construction shown here is also a truss construction, in which case the plates
extend over the length of the bridge. In the longitudinal direction the construction functions as a girder-web plate
construction and in the transverse direction as a truss construction.

- 5. Another construction form with integrated longitudinal and transverse stiffness is a full sandwich
construction. The sandwich construction shown here uses a continuous medium as sandwich core.
The most advantages are to use a foam construction in combination with a number of web plates. The
load due to a wheel is conducted transversely to the web plates, so that the foam does not conduct the
entire weight of the trucks.

- 6. The construction shown here is also a sandwich construction with integrated
longitudinal and transverse stiffness. Instead of a continuous medium, a honeycomb construction is used here.
- 7. Instead of conducting the wheel load in the width direction to the web plates, in this construction the
load in the longitudinal direction of the bridge is conducted by a stiffened road surface to the cross girders/
ribs. These cross girders/ribs are connected to the longitudinal girders and provide the required
transverse stiffness.
## 4.3 Comparison of the construction forms
The first construction form provides great advantages due to a small number of crossings of the different
components, the disadvantage is however the small construction height for achieving sufficient transverse
stiffness. The application of cross members/ribs leads to a strong increase in transverse
stiffness, but also leads to a strong increase in production costs.
Both truss constructions are effective because they integrate longitudinal and transverse stiffness.
Problems arise with these trusses when designing the intersections of the plates, especially when sandwich
plates are used, and the transfer of stresses from the web plates to the purlins. Another problem with these
truss constructions is the application of pivots and connections.
The sandwich constructions are also effective because longitudinal and transverse stiffness are integrated.
A disadvantage of the construction with a continuous medium as sandwich core is possibly the large volume of
foam (or other solid material) that is required. A disadvantage of the honeycomb construction is the complicated
production and the transfer of stresses from the web plates to the purlins.
In the last (seventh) construction form, a large number of intersections of the different components occur. This
construction is clearly not effectively produced with fibre-reinforced plastics.
In the following chapters two constructions will be studied, one with integrated and one with
decoupled longitudinal and transverse stiffness. Based on the above considerations the first construction form
is chosen, which changes into the second if the road surface does not provide sufficient stiffness, and the fifth
construction form is chosen. The first construction form will be referred to as the "multi-girder construction"
and the fifth construction form as the "sandwich construction".

## 5. The multi-girder construction
## 5.1 Introduction
In this chapter the multi-girder construction is studied, zf ^™ sn point 1 of figure 4.1. Two
°^
web plate distances are studied, a distance of Z and of 750 mm. The wheel load
is conducted via the road surface to the web plates and is then conducted to the supports
of the valley. Due to the low transverse stiffness of the construction, the aim is to have
supports over the entire width of the valley.
Since the traffic lanes and footpaths and cycle paths must meet different requirements,
the design of the construction will always be divided into the design of the traffic
lanes and the design of the footpaths and cycle paths.
For the time being, only the mobile tax and .
Sea loads, wind loads, etc. are not taken into account for the time being.
## 5.2 Body plate distance
As already mentioned in the introduction, two web plate distances (b) are studied, a distance of 500 and 750
mm. The distance between the web plates largely determines the properties of the required road surface. The
smaller the distance between the web plates, the lighter (less loaded) the road surface, but the higher the
production costs of the main structure are likely to be.
A small distance between the web plates may be required to obtain a good transfer of
stresses from the web plates to the purlins. If the distance between the web plates is
large, a supporting width may have to be taken into account.
## 5.3 The road surface
## 5.3.1 Form and function
The road surface must be able to absorb local pressure loads, both static and impact loads,
and must be able to transmit the wheel load to the lifting plates. For the first function, a
top layer with good pressure and impact properties is required. For the second function,
a large Lstructure height is favourable. If only one material is used to cover both
functions, this can lead to a very high weight. It is therefore preferable to
partially separate these two functions. This is done by using a double sandwich
construction as shown schematically in figure 5.1.
<!-- image -->
Figure 5.1: A double sandwich construction

<!-- image -->
This figure shows a sandwich construction using two cores and three facings. The
function of the upper sandwich core is to spread the local compressive loads. The lower
core can have a lower compressive strength, but must be able to carry part of the shear
stress. The middle facing ensures that the upper core forms a separate sandwich
construction, which results in a good distribution of the compressive load.
As a second construction form, a box-shaped road surface is studied, as shown in figure
5.2. In this construction form, the transverse force resulting from the wheel load is not
transmitted by a sandwich core, but by fibre-reinforced plastic web plates.
Figure 5.2: A tubular road surface
<!-- image -->
## 5.3.2 Local pressure load on the road surface
## LANES
For the load class 60 traffic bridge studied here, a standard 60-ton vehicle is assumed,
as shown in figure 3.1. The wheel load must be multiplied by a load and impact coefficient,
the resultant of which (appendix A) for the bridge studied here is equal to 1.27.
<!-- image -->
For a contact surface of the wheel with the road surface of 250 by 350 mm, the following
results apply to the local compressive load:

## FOOT AND CYCLING PATHS
For footpaths and cycle paths, two load cases can be distinguished. A load that must be
continuously present on the footpaths of 4 kN/m and a 2 exceptional case where a 30 ton truck drives over
the footpaths and cycle paths (load class 30).
- i) A uniformly distributed load of 4 kN/m 2
- ii) A wheel surface of 250*350 mm with a load of 5 tonnes per wheel.
For the local pressure loads the second load case is decisive. This local pressure load is equal to
the pressure load on the lanes since the wheel load and the contact surface are equal.
## 5.3.3 Core materials of a double sandwich construction
## THE TOP SANDWICH CORE
For the upper, load-distributing sandwich core, three different materials are studied:
- 1. Plastic honeycomb
- 2. Balsa wood
- 3. RecycledPE or PUR
Due to corrosion problems, the use of an aluminum honeycomb is not possible and a suitable plastic
honeycomb will be sought here. Advantages of honeycomb are the low density and the constant quality, a
disadvantage is however the very high price.
As a second solution for this load-distributing core, balsa wood is being studied. This material combines good
compressive properties with a relatively low density. However, a major disadvantage of balsa is the fact that
its quality decreases over time.
As a third possibility recycled PE and PUR are studied. The possibility for both materials, both PE and PUR,
is still kept open here. For PE a low density variant is used, LDPE. Advantages of recycled PE/PUR are that
it is very pressure resistant, very cheap, in large quantities
<!-- image -->
dimensions and is of constant quality. A disadvantage of both materials is the relatively high density. A
specific disadvantage of PE is that it is difficult to glue, but this problem can be solved by vulcanizing a layer
of rubber of 1 to 2 mm onto the PE, which of course leads to a strong increase in production costs.

dimensions and is of constant quality. A disadvantage of both materials is the relatively high density. A
specific disadvantage of PE is that it is difficult to glue, but this problem can be solved by vulcanizing a layer
of rubber of 1 to 2 mm onto the PE, which of course leads to a strong increase in production costs.
For both balsa and PE/PUR the pressure load of both lanes and footpaths and cycle paths is no problem. There
are a number of types of honeycomb that can transmit the pressure load for the lanes (and footpaths
and cycle paths), these are (Lit.1 and Lit.3):
Hexcel: Material- Cell Dimensions- Density (lb/ft ) 3
HRP-3/16-4.0
NP-3/16-4.5
HRH-10-1/8-3.0
in which:
HRP
glass fiber reinforced phenolic
NP
glass fiber reinforced polyester
HRH
aramid fiber reinforced phenol
The shear stress in the sandwich construction may of course require an even higher quality honeycomb than
determined here on the basis of compressive properties.
## THE BOTTOM SANDWICH CORE
The lower core will use PVC foam, which can transfer a reasonably high shear load but has a lower compressive
strength than the materials discussed above.
The density of the PVC foam used depends on the thickness of the upper core and is dependent on the
shear stresses that occur.
If diffusion of the loads is assumed to take place at an angle of 45°, the local compressive load in the lower
sandwich core can be calculated as a function of the thickness of the upper sandwich core. If a
safety factor of 1.5 is applied to the load and a safety factor of 2 is applied to the materials, this gives for the
required foam of the lower core as a function of the thickness of the upper core (Lit.8):

The allowable shear stress in the PVC may require a higher grade than calculated on the basis
of the local compressive loads.
## COST AND COMPARISON OF THE CORE MATERIALS
The choice of core material obviously depends greatly on the costs of this material. In principle, the cheapest
solution will be chosen. However, if the weight gains are very large by using a material other than the cheapest,
the extra costs can be earned back by the snowball effect. It is obviously difficult to estimate the cost
gains in other construction parts by a kilogram of weight gain in the road surface. For the materials discussed
above, the prices and densities are:
Balsa
fl
2595,- /m 3
p = 0.2 kg/dm 3
PE/PUR
fl
3,- /kg

p = 0.8-1.0 kg/dm 3

R200 60 mm 546,-)?/m 2
R260 60 mm 734,-^7/m 2
R300 60 mm 950,-/7/m 2
In order to make a material choice for the top sandwich core, the costs per m will be compared for the case that
the top 2 sandwich cores are 30 mm thick (an initial estimate).
For the honeycomb core, a density of 64 kg/m is assumed at a price of 3 fl 600,- /no.

Table 5.2: Comparison of core materials of the upper core of a double sandwich construction.
The honeycomb construction leads to very high costs, but also to very low weights. However, it seems plausible
that a weight reduction of 816 kg compared to balsa is not worth fl 104,400. The use of PE/PUR results
in low costs but a high weight. Compared to balsa, PE/PUR results in approximately the same costs, but a
3600 kg higher weight. However, PE/PUR does provide the advantages already described above with regard
to pressure resistance, available dimensions and quality. Balsa provides the best combination of weight
and costs, but does have the disadvantage of a reduction in quality already mentioned.
<!-- image -->
Due to costs and required durability, PE/PUR is chosen at this stage as the core material for the upper
sandwich core of the double sandwich construction.

## 5.3.4 Shear forces and moments in the sandwich construction of the road surface
In this section an estimate will be made of the transverse forces and moments
in the road surface. As a first estimate a 2-dimensional situation is studied, although in
reality the situation is of course 3-dimensional. In this way an overestimation of the real
stresses probably occurs. At this stage no account is taken of a braking load, this subject
will be discussed in more detail in the final thesis of the author.
## LANES

## FOOT AND CYCLING PATHS

## 5.3.5 Calculation parameters for a double sandwich construction
- f, = thickness of the top facing
- h 2 = thickness of the top sandwich core
- /, = thickness of the middle facing
- /z = thickness of the lower sandwich core 4
- ts = thickness of the lower facing

The shear stresses in the different parts of the double sandwich construction
are given by:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
in which:
- V the shear force to be transmitted
- Q' is the static moment corrected for stiffness
- b the load-bearing width
- EI the bending stiffness of the cross-section
For the static moment, corrected for the calculation of different stiffnesses, the
following applies:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- image -->
The location of the neutral line follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If the neutral line is above the center facing:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Where Q is the static moment for calculating the maximum shear stress in the upper sandwich core
and O\ is the static moment for calculating the maximum shear stress in the lower sandwich core.
If the neutral line is below the center facing:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Where Q\ is the static moment for calculating the maximum shear stress in the upper sandwich core and
'
Q[ n is the static moment for calculating the maximum shear stress in the lower sandwich core.
However, following the author's graduation assignment, it has become apparent that not
the deformations in both sandwich cores, but the stresses in both sandwich cores are
equal. The approach described above is therefore incorrect. but the shear stresses
can be easily obtained by dividing the shear force over the surface over which the shear
force prevails:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: h is the thickness of both sandwich cores together

The following calculations will be based on formula [5.3-18].
<!-- image -->
## 5.3.6 Calculations on the road surface carried out as a double sandwich construction
The calculations will use GFRP facings, as it is expected that this will provide a cheap and also
impact-resistant (more material needs to be added than with CFRP) construction.
Initially, a UD E-glass reinforced polyester or epoxy construction with the following properties
will be assumed:

For an accurate calculation of costs, please refer to section 5.5.
## LANES
Since the permissible shear stress of the upper sandwich core (PE/PUR) is
higher than the permissible shear stress of a PVC foam, the shear stress in the foam will be
decisive for the total thickness of the sandwich construction (see formula [5.3-18]). The
calculations quickly show that, in connection with shear stresses, a higher quality foam is
required than determined on the basis of local compressive stresses. Below are some deck
heights shown as a function of the foam used, whereby a total safety factor of 3.0 is calculated:

R200 h = 112.3 mm
R260 / i = 88.37 mm
R300 ^

Making a choice of the height and distribution of the two cores over this height
depends on:
- Costs of the core material.
- · Permissible height of the road surface.
- · Maximum available thicknesses of the core material. For example, the foam cores are supplied in a maximum
height of 60 mm.
- · The total weight must not be too high.
## LANES
Based on the previous calculations, the following structure of the double sandwich
construction of the road surface can be chosen:
b = 500 mm 21 mm PE/PUR and 60 mm R260
b = 750 mm 30 mm PE/PUR and 60 mm R300

For both body plate distances this gives approximately the following costs and weights of
core material:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If the contribution of the middle facing is neglected, the bending stiffness is approximately
as follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- image -->
For the selected sandwich cores the following follows (where the shear stiffness
(G) of the foam is maintained):
h
= 500 mm
h
Vm
=
81mm bm = 431 mm
G = 104.8 Mpa
6 = 750 mm A kef J 1 = 90 mm bm = 440 mm
This results in a deflection due to shear of:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The deflection due to shear is therefore almost equal to the permissible deflection (1/250
of the web distance) and the deflection due to bending must therefore be very small.
However, since the deformation is a 3-dimensional state, it is expected that the
deflection due to shear is less than 70% of the value calculated above. The permissible
deflection due to bending will indeed be calculated with 70% of the values calculated
above.
The permissible deflection results in:
b = 500 mm c\ = 0.67 mm / ( ac = 4.2 mm (1.4 mm for bending only) b = 750 mm c\ = 1.32
mm ffac = 6.4 mm (2.8 mm for bending only)

b = 500 mm c\ = 0.67 mm / ( ac = 4.2 mm (1.4 mm for bending only) b = 750 mm c\ = 1.32
mm ffac = 6.4 mm (2.8 mm for bending only)
The permissible stresses result (under pressure):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Since an epoxy reinforced construction will also be used for the remaining
construction, an epoxy matrix is also chosen here. The calculations further show that
the design of the facings is indeed determined by stiffness.
For both body plate distances this results in the following costs and weights of facing
material:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

G= 123.3 Mpa
For both body plate distances this gives the following total costs and weights:
h = 500 mm W=4702 kg K=fl 112,037,-
h = 750 mm ^=6427 kg K = // 153,395,-
For a web plate distance of 750 mm, this results in fl 41,358 higher costs with a 1725
kg higher weight compared to a web plate distance of 500 mm.
## FOOT AND CYCLING PATHS
For example, for the footpaths and cycle paths, the following is the structure of the double sandwich
construction:
b = 500 mm same structure as for the lanes b = 750 mm 17 mm
PE/PUR and 60 mm R300
For both body plate distances this gives approximately the following costs and weights of
core material:
b = 500 mm equal to the lanes b = 500 mm ^=3160 kg K=fl 99,080.-
The following applies to the selected sandwich cores:
b = 500 mm equal to lanes b = 750 mm
/t kem

=
77 mm bm = 427 mm
This results in a deflection due to shear of:
b = 500 mm equal to the lanes b = 750 mm S s = 2.9 mm
If it is again assumed that the actual deflection due to shear is 30% lower, then:
b = 500 mm equal to the lanes b = 750 mm c\ = 0.97 mm tfx = 12.1 mm (3.9 mm for bending
only)

G= 123.3 Mpa
The permissible stresses result (under pressure):
b = 500 mm equal to the lanes b = 750 mm / tatpolycs I a = 2.0 mm t fK . q ,' xv = 1. 3 mm
An epoxy reinforced construction is chosen, whereby the design of the facings of the road surface
is again determined by stiffness.
For both body plate distances this results in the following costs and weights of facing
material:
b = 500 mm equal to lanes b = 750 mm W = M\\ kg K=fl 96,790,-
For both body plate distances this gives the following total costs and weights:
b = 500 mm ff=4702 kg K=fl 112,037,-
6 = 750 mm fT= 7371 kg K=fl 195,870,-
For a web plate distance of 750 mm this results in fl 83,833 higher costs with a 2669 kg
higher weight compared to a web plate distance of 500 mm. For a web plate distance of 750
mm, the costs and weights for the footpaths and cycle paths are even higher than for the
traffic lanes. This is mainly the result of the high facing costs and weights, which are a
consequence of the lower height of the sandwich construction. It is therefore probably
better to opt for a higher sandwich construction, which leads to higher core material costs, but
also to a significant reduction in the facing costs.
## WEAR LAYER
On the road surface discussed here, a wearing course still needs to be applied in
connection with wear and roughness. There are basically two possibilities for this:

On the road surface discussed here, a wearing course still needs to be applied
in connection with wear and roughness. There are basically two possibilities for this:
- 1. A layer of epoxy with gravel applied to the deck.
- 2. Detachable panels that are screwed to the deck.
In the first option, it must be taken into account that the layer must be able to be removed
using a milling machine. which will damage the composite. The preference will
therefore also go to the second option. Determining the precise composition of these panels
falls outside the scope of this report

## 5.3.7 Road surface made of box-shaped profiles
In this section a road surface is studied that is constructed from box-shaped profiles, as
shown in figure 5.2. For reasons of manufacturability, 0-90° fabrics will be used for the time

The bending moment due to a wheel in the middle of the web plates is also equal to:
b = 500 mm .V/ max = 5.84 10 Nmm 6

In this position of the wheels there is again a deflection due to bending between the web

With an allowable deflection of 1/250 of the length, this results in:

The following applies approximately to the deflection between the road surface web plates:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Where the bending stiffness is given by:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: / gor is the thickness of the purlins of the road surface
For an allowable deflection of 1/250 of the web plate distance, the following
applies for both web plate distances:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The calculations show that the thickness of the purlins can be smaller than the thickness of the
road surface's web plates due to the deflection between the web plates of the main girders.
However, due to the deflection between the web plates of the road surface, the thickness of
the upper purlin must be considerably higher. The aim is to achieve a construction in which
the material of the web plates continues completely (per tube), in which tubes with a constant
thickness are used. after which extra UD material is added to the purlins in the
direction of travel in order to minimise the deflection between the web plates of the road
surface. Only a small percentage of UD material is added to the lower purlin in order to absorb
bending stresses in the longitudinal direction of the bridge, which lead to "peel stresses"
between the tubes. The structure of the tubes then looks as follows:

## LANES
b = 500 mm 3.9 mm 0-90° tubes bottom purlin 0.4 mm extra UD (no actual guideline for) top
purlin 6.0 mm extra UD

upper purlin 5.6 mm extra UD
Another possibility is of course to construct the upper belt of the road surface as a sandwich
construction, but this possibility will not be discussed further here.
The following applies to the interlaminar shear stress in the upper purlin of the road surface:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

These interlaminar shear stresses are indeed low enough.

## STABILITY OF\_ THE BOY ENGORDHSG
The stiffness terms of the purlins were determined using the Plamor program.

## FOOT AND CYCLING PATHS

## 5.3.8 Choice of road surface type
Based on previous calculations, preference is given to the use of a box-shaped road
surface. With the help of this construction, lower costs and weights can be
obtained. with a high lifespan. Of course, a proper solution must still be found for absorbing
the braking load. However, this subject will be discussed in more detail in the author's
graduation assignment.
## 5.4 The main construction
For both the purlins and the web plates, a constant material thickness and composition are assumed over the
entire length of the bridge. In fact, further optimisation is still possible at this point. The best choice of material for
the main structure is also being studied. Both glass fibre and carbon fibre reinforced structures are being
considered. Aramid is not being considered due to its poor fatigue and pressure properties. For the glass
fibre reinforced structure, E-glass with a polyester matrix is initially assumed.

Aramid is not considered due to its poor fatigue and pressure properties. For the glass fibre reinforced

## 5.4.1 Lane girders
## Stiffness/Deflection
Since the deflection is decisive, a stiffness design will be made, after which the strength
will be checked. As stated in the program of requirements, a deflection of the bridge is
allowed of 64 mm. It is assumed that the maximum deflection occurs in the middle
of the bridge and that this happens
when
<!-- image -->
the resultant of the wheel loads is also in the middle, then the maximum deflection
due to a row of wheels follows (see internship assignment Lit.4):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: P is the wheel load q is the uniformly distributed load L is the length of the fall
EI is the bending stiffness of the fall
The influence of the next row of wheels has been neglected here.
For a load-bearing width of 1500 mm, the following applies for the deflection due to two
rows of wheels (half carriage):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
With an allowable deflection of 64 mm, this results in a required bending stiffness of:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If a distance of 900 mm between the purlins is assumed (the total height may not exceed
1 metre and the road surface takes up approximately 100 mm), the moment of
inertia is as follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: h is the distance between the purlins, equal to the web plate height

Both a glass fibre and a carbon fibre reinforced construction are studied with a fibre volume
percentage of 40%. This gives the following elasticity moduli for unidirectional material:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If the purlins extend over the entire width of the roof, the required thickness is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- image -->
Another possibility is to laminate an aluminium plate into the purlins. Aluminium is preferable to steel because
of corrosion. Aluminium is considerably cheaper than carbon and has good mechanical properties:
= 25714 For £ = 72000 Mpa and p = 2.8 kg/dm 3 (E/p)^^ = 19506 For £ = 35111 Mpa and p = 1. 8 kg/dm 3 (Elp)
From this comparison it follows that if stiffness is decisive. with aluminum a lighter construction can be obtained.
To achieve the same stiffness it can be stated that the aluminum construction can be roughly 25% lighter than
the GFRP construction.
If the purlins were made entirely of aluminium, this would require a thickness of:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
However, it is relatively complicated to obtain a good bond between the fibre reinforced construction and the
aluminium plate. Due to corrosion and fatigue properties, it is also not advisable to laminate an aluminium plate.
## Checking the Voltages
The following applies to the bending moment (A/) due to two rows of wheels (one axle half) and for the
supporting width of 1500 mm (see internship assignment Lit.4):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
A moment must be added to this due to the distributed load:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This gives a total moment equal to:
M= 1.365 10 Nmm 9 bm = 1500 mm
<!-- image -->
The following applies to the stresses occurring in the purlins:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
For the GFRP construction a stress of 39.2 Mpa follows at an elongation of 0.11%. For
the CFRP construction a stress of 95.4 Mpa follows at an elongation of also 0.11%.
The following maximum permissible stresses apply to the CFRP construction (with an
epoxy resin):
$$<jx ', = 648 Mpa crd = 408 Mpa$$
in which:
er tM is the allowable tensile stress cr dall is the allowable compressive stress
This means that there is a safety factor of 4.3 on the compressive stress and 6.8
on the tensile stress.
The following maximum permissible stresses apply to the GFRP construction:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
This means that there is a safety factor of 6.2 on the compressive stress and 9.2
on the tensile stress.
## Costs and weights of GFRP purlins
With the area of the lanes equal to 100 nr (1.10 mm) this gives a s volume of GFRP of the
purlins alone equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
With the given fiber volume percentage of 40% for GFRP this yields:
F glass 3
polyester = 2064dm = 3096 dm3
With the densities of the materials:
pg I as = 2.55 kg/dm 3
ppolyester = 1.20 kg/dm 3

= 5263 kg
WM a = 3715 kg
<!-- image -->
^
total = 8978 kg
The total weight can also be calculated in one go as follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
With the following material prices:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Does this result in the following costs:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
For the time being, production costs are assumed to be based on hand lamination.
Each laminator processes approximately 10 kg (fibers + resin) per hour. With an hourly rate of fl 80,
- and this results in lamination costs:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If 10% is added to the total costs for the production of molds, this results in:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The total costs can also be derived from:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
## Costs and weights of CFRP purlins
Due to the simple shape, a cheap type of carbon of fl 50,-/kg can be used for the purlins. With a thickness of the
CFRP purlins of 10.6 mm, the following results:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
With the given fiber volume percentage of 40% for CFRP this yields:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If 10% is added to the total costs for the production of molds, this results in:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The total costs can also be derived from:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Due to the considerably higher stiffness of carbon and because lamination costs are a
significant part of the costs, the carbon fibre reinforced epoxy construction is almost as
expensive (fl 9,014 cheaper) as the glass fibre reinforced polyester construction at a
considerably lower weight (5925 kg). The author therefore prefers to use a carbon fibre reinforced
epoxy construction for the purlins.

## 5.4.2 Lane plates
In the previous paragraph the choice was made for a carbon fibre reinforced epoxy (or
vinylester) construction for the purlins. Since a resin system must be used for the entire bridge,
a construction with epoxy as matrix material must also be used for the web plates.

In the previous paragraph the choice was made for a carbon fibre reinforced epoxy (or vinylester)
construction for the purlins. Since a resin system must be used for the entire bridge, a construction with
epoxy as matrix material must also be used for the web plates.
Since the web plates are mainly determined by the shear strength and since the strengths
of a carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced epoxy construction differ very little, the cheapest construction will
be achieved using glass fiber reinforced epoxy web plates.
The force per wheel (including load and impact coefficient) is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The maximum transverse force due to two rows of wheels (half a carriage) is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: -F imposition the supporting force
As a result of the uniformly distributed load. at a web plate distance b and the number of
supporting web plates n follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The load per web plate depends on the web plate distance (b), assuming at this stage:
b = 500 mm
3 plates contribute
b = 750 mm 2 web plates contribute
The total shear force per web plate is therefore equal to:
b = 500 mm D= 130347 N
b = 750 mm D = 199521 N
Here the load due to the dead weight is neglected.
The resulting shear stress is equal to:

If the results are calculated using the allowable tissue (or UD) stresses, whereby the
normal force-absorbing effect of the +/-45° material is neglected, then:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
In this way a larger thickness is found since a lower shear stress is maintained than in the netting
theory.
The shear stress at which buckling occurs can be determined by (Lit. 9):

As far as wrinkling is concerned, in fact any PVC foam can be used.

If the contribution of the 90° material to the buckling stress is neglected, then the

The results obtained using the allowable tissue or UD tensions will be used to determine the costs and
weights.

## 5.4.3 Purlins of the footpaths and cycle paths
Since a CFRP construction has been chosen for the lanes, a CFRP construction will also
be used here.
For the footpaths, the strength must take into account a 30-ton truck passing the bridge.
However, this situation is exceptional and the deflection does not have to meet the required
1/250. A strength design will be made for the situation where there is a 30-ton truck on the
bridge and then the deflection will be checked for the normal load of 4 kN/m. 2

## 5.4.4 Body plates of the footpaths and cycle paths
Based on the same considerations as for the web plates of the lanes, GFRP epoxy (or vinylester) web
plates are also chosen here. The load on the web plates depends on the distance between the web plates.
The same assumptions are made here as in paragraph 5.5.2.
The force per wheel is equal to:

The maximum transverse force due to a row of wheels (3 wheels) is equal to:

construction differ very little. With a web plate distance of 750 mm a 235 kg lighter
construction follows at/7 752.- lower costs.
## 5.5 Transverse stiffness of the trap
## 5.5.1 Calculations on the transverse stiffness of the fall
In this section it is studied whether the transverse stiffness of the fall is sufficient. A
calculation is performed with the program Mathcad (using ROARK Lit. 14), in which the
road surface is schematized as a continuously resiliently supported beam. These
calculations are shown in the appendices.
For a web plate distance of the main girders of 750 mm, the following results apply to the
bending stiffness of the structure around a web plate:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- image -->
The stiffness of the spring support is as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The influence of 1 wheel, an axle of a carriage and an axle of two carriages (one axle of
each carriage, whereby all wheels are on a line) is studied. The calculations result in the
maximum deflection and the supporting width (the width over which deflection occurs):
| • A single wheel |
J mbm = 1/300 |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|---
----------------------|
| • A car | J mbm = 1/184 |
| • Two cars | J mbm = 1/320 |
: 5 mm = 10.5 mm | bm
= 3150 mm | 5
: S mdX = 24.1 mm | b
= m 4438 mm | S
: S max = 23.3 mm | b
= m 7454 mm | 8
Due to the other axles of the truck, the deflection increases, but the load-bearing
width does not actually increase. As can be seen from the results, the relative deflection due
to a single vehicle is too large (&gt;l/250 part). At the maximum deflection, due to a vehicle, of
55 mm, a relative deflection in the transverse direction of 1/80 part of the load-bearing
width follows, which is therefore much too low. It is therefore probably necessary to fit
crossbeams.
The calculations also show that if the wagons are too close to the side of the bridge, a bending
occurs on the side, which in fact means that the bridge comes loose from the
supports at that location. Since this phenomenon is not permitted, it is also necessary to
increase the transverse stiffness in this respect. If the wagon is at a distance greater than 3120
mm from the side of the bridge, no bending occurs.
The calculations also show that the load-bearing widths are considerably larger than previously
assumed. This means that more web plates will be supported and that a larger part of the purlins will be
supported, which means that the thicknesses of these parts can decrease.
## 5.5.2 Installing sleepers
If it is necessary to increase the transverse stiffness of the fall, this can be achieved by
applying crossbeams. At the location of the suspension rods and rack rods, it is also necessary
to apply crossbeams, as the relatively high loads would otherwise lead to very large
deformations in the width direction. These crossbeams can in principle be applied in two ways:
- · Sleepers are installed in the road surface with a height equal to the construction

the construction of the road surface can be easily interrupted for the insertion of these
sleepers. However, in terms of construction, this solution is

- · Sleepers are installed in the road surface with a height equal to the construction
height of the road surface. This solution is very simple in terms of production technology,
as the construction of the road surface can be easily interrupted for the insertion of these
sleepers. However, in terms of construction, this solution is
<!-- image -->
less effective as the height of the sleepers is limited to the height of the road surface.
- · Cross beams are placed between the main beams, whereby the construction
height of the beams is equal to the web plate height of 900 mm. From a
production-technical point of view, this solution is not so complicated, but it is
labour-intensive.
These sleepers can be produced as individual tubes and then glued
between the main girders.
It is recommended to connect the purlins of the various sleeper sections using
connectors (CFRP plates the width of the sleepers, which extend over the entire width
of the roof).
Figure 5.4: Installing sleepers
<!-- image -->
Especially at the location of suspension rods and rack rods it is necessary to
install the second type of cross ties in order to obtain sufficiently high transverse
stiffness.
## 5.6 Supporting width of the main girders' purlins
In this section it will be investigated whether it is correct to assume that the full hat width
(750mm) is supported. First a situation is studied where the 0° material of the purlins is
only connected to the +/- 45° material on one plane (for a schematic representation see
figure 5.5).

For the lanes and for the upper girder of the cycle paths, the deformations are such that a
supporting width must probably be taken into account. For the lanes this will probably
not be a problem since these are determined by stiffness, but for the cycle paths extra
material must be added.
## 5. 7 Total layout and total weights and costs
The calculations show that the costs and weights of the main structure differ only
very slightly for both studied web spacings. Since cross ties have to be fitted at the
location of the suspension rods and rack rods, the author prefers a web spacing of 750
mm, since a larger web spacing results in fewer crossings of longitudinal ties and cross
ties. The costs of the cross ties when fitting two cross ties across the entire width of the
valley, one at the location of the suspension rods
<!-- image -->
and one at the location of the rack rods is estimated at fl 37,000. The weight of
these cross ties is estimated at 1150 kg.
For the road surface, the author prefers a 0-90° GFRP epoxy (or vinylester) box-shaped
road surface. For the main structure, the preference is for CFRP purlins
in combination with GFRP web plates, using an epoxy (or vinylester) matrix. For
this structure, the total costs and weights are equal to:

structure, the total costs and weights are equal to:
Table 5.5: Weights and cost structure for the entire multi-girder construction.

However, these costs and weights do not take into account additional costs resulting from
construction details.
A steel trap with the same dimensions weighs approximately 52,500 kg at a cost of fl 630,000.
The composite construction is therefore 35,702 kg lighter and the costs are/7 101,194 lower.
## 5.8 Production of the multi-girder construction
The construction considered so far cannot be produced as a closed box construction. Two
producible construction forms are shown in figure 5.6:
<!-- image -->
<!-- image -->
- 1. A closed construction is not used, but a kind of hat construction. Since the 0° layers of the
purlins can be alternated in this way with the +/- 45° layers of the web plates, the transfer of
tensions from the web plates to the purlins is optimal. A disadvantage of this construction is
that only half of the total width of the valley is available for applying 0° material, which means
that the purlins are twice as thick as calculated above.
- 2. A similar shape is produced as described above, this time however completely from +/- 45°
(and 90°) material. The purlins are glued to the hat construction as plates at the top
and bottom. With this construction form, however, the transfer of stresses from the
web plates to the purlins is not optimal and as calculated above, a certain supporting width will
have to be taken into account in this case.

- 2. A similar shape is produced as described above, this time however completely from +/-
45° (and 90°) material. The purlins are glued to the hat construction as plates at
the top and bottom. With this construction form, however, the transfer of stresses
from the web plates to the purlins is not optimal and as calculated above, a certain
supporting width will have to be taken into account in this case.
An intermediate solution is also possible where a percentage of 0° material is laminated
and a percentage is glued as a plate onto the hat construction.
Both construction forms can be produced well using hand lamination, whereby in principle the entire construction
can be laminated in one go. However, if Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) is used, it is preferable to divide
the construction into repeating parts. For example, hat profiles can be used (see figure 5.6) which are then
glued to the road surface. If this process is used, a higher quality product can be obtained than with hand
lamination, although the costs are probably somewhat higher.

## 6 The sandwich construction
## 6.1 Introduction
In this chapter a complete sandwich construction is studied, with integrated
longitudinal and transverse direction, as described under point 5 of figure 4.1. The
most advantages are to use a sandwich construction in combination with a number
of web plates. The load due to a wheel is conducted by the sandwich core (the foam) to the
web plates, so that the sandwich core does not have to conduct the entire weight of the
trucks.
## 6.2 Pros and cons
This sandwich construction with a number of web plates provides the following
advantages:
- · The entire height of the bridge is used to obtain transverse stiffness.
- · Simpler production due to few intersections compared to a construction with cross-ties/
ribs.
- · An even transfer of stresses from the web plates to the purlins.
- · There is a small number of body plates, which leads to simpler production.
- · The foam serves as a mold during production.
The construction has the following disadvantages:
- · The foam must be protected against water absorption.
- · Gluing the foam parts is labor-intensive.
- · The course of stresses and deformations is not yet fully known at this stage.

- · Inspection and maintenance is relatively complicated.
## 6.3 Distance between the web plates
When designing the structure, it is assumed that the load in the foam due to a wheel is
transferred to the web plates. The foam is therefore only loaded by a wheel and not by
an entire truck. To achieve this, the distance between the web plates must be
smaller than the wheelbase.
The distance must be large enough to distribute the load over the entire height. At this
stage, a mutual distance of 1500 mm between the web plates is chosen. Given the high
shear stiffness of the web plates compared to the foam, they will indeed attract the most
load (a force takes the stiffest path).
The approach used here, that the foam only transmits the load of 1 wheel, is
crucial for the entire design. The correctness of this may have to be checked
using a finite element calculation.
<!-- image -->
## 6.4 The sandwich core
It is obvious to use a foam, since the material must have a low density. If the bridge is
not to become too heavy. The foam only needs to be able to carry the load of a single
wheel. The use of PVC is too expensive, so it is preferable to use a cheaper
foam such as polystyrene.
High compressive strength polystyrene is Floormate 700, with a compressive strength
of 0.7 Mpa. The continuous compressive stress that is allowed is 0.25 Mpa. The
maximum allowable shear stress is about 0.5 Mpa.
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The costs are approximately fl 535,-/m and the density is equal to 45 kg/m. 3 3
## 6.5 The "road surface"
This construction will involve a sandwich-shaped road surface that will ensure
proper load distribution.
## LANES AND FOOTPATHS AND CYCLE PATHS TOGETHER
The local compressive stress is given by:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
wheel -/-/v With an allowable compressive stress in the polystyrene of 0.25 Mpa, a load-
spreading height of 100 mm follows (if the load spreads under 45°). The structure of the
construction then looks like this, for example:

## LANES
The shear force occurring per unit width is approximately equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The supporting width is provisionally estimated at 600 mm. The shear force per unit width follows for
the chosen web plate distance:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
For the shear stress in the width direction, this results in:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
So this shear stress is just low enough.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
For the shear stress in the width direction, this results in:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
This shear stress is therefore more than low enough.
## 6.6 Flexural stiffness in transverse direction
Since the structural member between the web plates cannot deform freely, the
deflection between these web plates will be small. The required stiffness/strength in
transverse direction is therefore determined on the basis of a characteristic bending
moment.
<!-- image -->
## LANES
For the lanes the characteristic moment is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If the distance between the purlins is 1000 mm and they are made of UD GFRP and the
supporting width is 600 mm, then the following (with the same thickness of the top and
bottom facing):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
There is no real guideline for determining the facing thickness between R90 and polystyrene.
The cost of these GFRP epoxy facings amounts to NLG 3,200, with a weight of 139.2 kg.

kg.
## 6.7 The main construction

## 6.7.1 Lane girders
With this construction form, the full height of 1 meter can be used. Since the construction is determined by
stiffness, this results in 19% thinner and lighter purlins compared to the construction from the previous
chapter. Here too,
<!-- image -->
so carbon is used and this gives the following total costs and weights for the purlins:
/ = 8.6 mm
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
## 6.7.2 Lane plates
The load in the web plates is probably highest if the truck with a bicycle is driving directly above a web plate. In
this case it is assumed that the load of an axle half is carried by only one web plate.
The total shear force per web plate is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Here the force due to self-fighting is neglected.
The resulting shear stress is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The foam can carry the pressure load, so the web plates can consist entirely of +/- 45° material. With a
height of the web plates (h) of 900 mm, a thickness of 10.4 mm follows. When continuing the material
of the web plates in the purlins, this results in the following costs and weights for 4 web plates:

As the calculations show, the complete sandwich construction is
approximately // 76,127.- cheaper and 4183 kg heavier than the multi-girder construction. However,
the multi-girder construction has the advantage of being considerably easier to inspect.
Furthermore, water absorption by the polystyrene can result in a decrease in quality (and
an increase in weight). The personal preference of the author therefore goes to the construction
from chapter 5, the multi-girder construction.

## 7 Pivots and Connections
## 7. / introduction
In this chapter the most important pivot points and connections of and to the fall will be discussed. The
multi-girder construction is used as the main construction of the fall. The construction details that
are studied are:
- · Impositions of the fall.
- · Pivot points of the fall.
- · Attaching the suspension rods to the halyard (or to the side beams).
- ·· Attaching the rack rods to the halyard (or to the side beams).
- · Attachment of side beams to the halyard.
First, the forces in these structural details are determined and then a number of structural solutions are
studied.

## 7.2 Loads in the connections

## 7 .2.2 Suspension rod forces
The suspension rod forces are determined for two situations, when the bridge is
closed and when it is open.

with the vertical must first be determined.

the suspension rod force follows:

Two forms of the balance primes are studied:
- 1. form 1, a maximum length of 16.5 m for the pivot point
- 2. shape 2. with a length of 12.5 m for the pivot point
For these two different balance pin shapes, this produces the following suspension rod

The calculation of the pivot forces is divided into three situations, in the first situation the bridge

there is no wind and in the third situation the bridge is fully opened and there is a wind load on
the bridge bridge.
When the bridge is just opening and there is no wind, for form 1 of the balance prongs (and

## 7.3 Impositions of the fall
## 7.3.1 Construction possibilities
Given the low transverse stiffness of the bridge, the aim will be to provide support over the entire
width of the bridge (continuous or only discrete at the web plates).

There are a number of possibilities to construct these supports. An important point to take
into account is the fact that the load must be introduced evenly over the height of the web plates.
An even introduction can be achieved by applying a tapered "beam" over the entire height of the bridge.
Materials that are suitable for such a "beam" are: steel, aluminium and composite. With composites, tapering can
be achieved by varying the laminate thickness over the height.
Depending on the load, a glue or bolt connection can be used. A glue connection is preferred, as this is a
continuous connection with a uniform force introduction. However, if the occurring stresses
appear to be too high for a glue connection, a bolt connection will be used.
The construction possibilities for the supports are shown in figure 7 .1. Each construction possibility will be briefly
explained here. In almost all forms, a fitting is used that is attached to the composite construction.
This fitting is for example U-shaped, with a solid plate attached to the underside. In this way a sufficiently large
support surface can be obtained with a reasonable weight. Since the steel or aluminium of the fitting is
considerably stiffer than the material of the other support surface, it may be assumed that the entire support
surface bears.
Below the constructive solutions shown in Figure 7.1 are briefly explained:
- 1. Depending on the number of web plates, forces are introduced over the entire width
of the end rib or only locally at the web plates. It goes without saying that the first possibility is considered
if the web plates are at a short distance. With this construction solution in which the fitting is attached to
the end rib, "peel stresses" occur in the
<!-- image -->
glue seam, which will however be low because a low-friction material is used for the supports.
- 2. If web plates are used at a greater distance from each other, it is obvious to use a number of
discrete supports at the web plates. In this case, the fittings are again attached to the end rib.
- 3. In this construction form the fittings are attached to the web plates. As a result, no peel stresses occur in
the glue seam, but an eccentricity does occur.
- 4. In order to reduce the eccentricity of the previous construction form, the same fitting can of
course be applied to both sides of a web plate. This method of construction also has the advantage that if a
sandwich construction is used, both facings are connected with a fitting.

sandwich construction is used, both facings are connected with a fitting.
- 5. This construction form is in fact the same as that discussed above, except that in this case the
fittings are attached to both the web plates and the end rib.
- 6. In this construction form, a sliding surface/strip is applied under the end ribs. Since the
construction has a high stiffness at the location of the rib-web plate intersection, a relatively large
surface of the support will carry. The thickness of the laminate can again decrease over the height.
## 7.3.2 Fittings and support surfaces
The calculations for the fittings and support surfaces are based on one support per web plate.
## LANES
For both body plate distances studied, the maximum support force is
(F superimposition) (ignoring the contribution of the dead weight) equal to:
b = 500 mm F support = 130347 N (case i)
b = 750 mm
F

= 199521 N
(case ii)
## FOOT AND CYCLING PATHS
For both body plate distances studied, the maximum support force (ignoring the contribution of the dead weight)
is equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
(case Hi)
## SEIZED
The surface of a cross-section of the fitting is determined at the bottom by the maximum permissible
stress and can theoretically decrease upwards to a thickness of "0". Initially, a steel fitting is sought because in
this way the correct shape can be easily obtained with the aid of welding. The following values apply to
stainless steel:

= 1145 Mpa (safety factor of 1.5 on rupture value)
= 188843 MPa
The required surface area of the underside G4 bes | ag ) is as follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
In the support force, the force due to the bridge's own weight is neglected. For the traffic lanes and
footpaths and cycle paths, the following follows:
- i) Aesiag = 665 mm 2
- ii) ^besiag = 1 0 1 8 mm 2
- iii) Aesiag = 417mm 2
## SUPPORT SURFACES
The aim is to achieve a low-friction and wear-resistant support.
A material that can meet these requirements is UHMWPE (ultra high modulus polyethylene). For
this material the maximum allowable surface pressure is equal to 10 Mpa (obtained from
experiments). The compression of UHMWPE is viscoelastic and can be calculated with the
following approximate formula:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
in which:
p
t
= the average surface pressure (Mpa) = the (summed) loading time (min)
For double-sided supported parts, the depression is halved.
Assuming that the bridge is loaded for 8 hours per day by half the maximum load, this gives an
open time of 8760000 minutes over a period of 50 years. This gives a compression of 2.4% at a
surface pressure of 5 Mpa (half the maximum load), which is more than low enough.

With a safety factor of 1.5 on the permissible surface pressure of 10 Mpa, the required surface
area of the supports (A support) results in:
- i) ^ overlay = 19552 mm 2
- ii) ^ overlay = 29928 mm 2
- iii) A support = 12264 mm 2
Two different situations are studied, one where only one fitting is attached per web plate
and one where two fittings are attached per web plate. The calculations are shown for the first
case with the values for using two fittings in brackets. Initially assuming square supports
this gives:
- 0 ^opheight = 140 mm (98.9 mm)

These values are probably so low that they lead to buckling phenomena. For buckling of a plate
that is supported on one side, the following applies:

These values are probably so low that they lead to buckling phenomena. For buckling of a plate
that is supported on one side, the following applies:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
With a safety factor of 2.0 on buckling, the following results for the required thickness:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Whereby the thickness must be greater than the value calculated above.
For the side walls of the fitting, follow these steps:
- (i) t = 4.8 mm (4.3 mm)
- (ii) t 5.9 mm (5.3 mm)
- (iii) t = 3.8 mm (3.4 mm)
Depending on the production method used, the thickness of the side walls and rear wall of
the fitting can or cannot be varied. If the fitting is welded from sheet metal, the
thickness can be varied, but if the U-shape is obtained using, for example, edges, the thickness
cannot differ.
For the part of the coating applied to the laminate, the following applies (ignoring the contribution
of the laminate):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
- (i) t = 2.6 mm (1.2 mm)
- (ii) t = 3.2 mm (1.5 mm)
- (iii) t = 2.1 mm (0.9 mm)

## 7.3.3 Tensions in the glue seam in a glued fitting
Since there is no exact solution available, the problem will be schematized in such a way that
a solution is available and the stresses are overestimated. The schematization used is shown in
figure 7.3.
I 1/ 2 T
Figure 7.3: Schematic used when calculating the glue seam
<!-- image -->
The following two formulas for the shear stress in a bonded joint will be used (Lit. 9):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

in which:
You m
the shear modulus of the adhesive
r H jm
the thickness of the glue seam
T
the load on the glue seam
/
the overlap length
A, characteristic adhesive parameter
Gj shear moduli of different materials
tt
thicknesses of different materials
The following applies to the load on the connection:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Where h is the height of the connection, equal to the height of the web plates.
<!-- image -->
The maximum peak voltage that can be tolerated is 5 to 6 MPa.
This relatively low value must be maintained because the influence of moisture and service life on the
adhesive seam cannot be predicted exactly.
A polyurethane adhesive with the following representative properties is used:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
Initially, a laminate is assumed to be constructed from +/-45° GFRP:
- 0 &lt; GFRP = 3.5mm
- ii) '
FRP G = 5.3mm
- iii) * GFRP = 2-2 mm
The calculations are performed using mathcad and are shown in the appendices. The peak stresses
in the glue joint follow from the calculations:

- i) rpeak = 6.5 Mpa (4.6 Mpa)
- ii) r , p ek = 8.1Mpa(5.7Mpa)
- iii) rpeak = 5.1 Mpa (3.6 Mpa)
To keep the shear stress below the required value of 6 Mpa, the thickness of the GFRP laminate must increase
to:
- i) '
- ii) '
- iii) -
GFRP = 4.0 mm
GFRP = 10-0 mm
In principle, it is therefore preferable to use two fittings so that the tensions in the glue seam are low and no
eccentricities occur.
## 7.3.4 Fittings with bolt connection
Here the required number of bolts will be calculated if a fitting is used that is attached to the construction with
a bolt connection. The bolt connection has the advantage that no significant ageing occurs. A disadvantage,
however, is that the load is only introduced at a limited number of places.
<!-- image -->
If an additional safety factor of 2 is applied because not all bolts bear an equal share of the load, the
following applies for the required number of bolts and the "bearing stress" (Lit. 9):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
in which:
&lt;xb the bearing pressure
- d the bolt diameter
- t is the thickness of the composite
- &lt;T b; all the allowable bearing stress
- n the required number of bolts
At the given loads, the following bolts are required as a minimum:
- i) 2 rows of 3 M l 6 bolts (or total 9 M l 2 bolts)
- ii) 2 rows of 4 M16 bolts (or total 5 M20 bolts)
- iii) 2 rows of 2 M l 6 bolts (or total 6 M12 bolts)
The nominal voltage follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
in which:

F
the suspension rod or rack force t the thickness of the laminate
r
the number of bolt rows
Assuming that the same theory holds as for metals (which is not entirely the case), then the
following applies to the peak voltage at the hole:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: K t is the stress concentration factor (for a circular hole equal to 3)
y
<!-- image -->
Based on the permissible peak stress next to the hole, the following results apply to the thicknesses
of the steel and composite (with the required thicknesses based on bearing stress stated in
brackets), whereby a factor of 1.33 is taken into account for the permissible stress in steel in
connection with fatigue:
- i) tw = 28.3 mm (r GFRP = 27.2 mm) rsteel = 24.6 mm (r steel = 3.6 mm)
- ii) ro = 33.2 mm (r 90 GFRP = 31.2 mm) rsteel = 28.8 mm (r steel = 4.1 mm)
- iii) r 90 . = 24.3 mm(r GFRP = 25.6 mm) rsteel = 21.1 mm (r steel = 3.3 mm)
,
where: t g0 . the required thickness of 90° material (height direction of the web plates)
The above values apply to the asymmetrically applied fittings. It appears that a great deal of material has to be
added based on the peak stresses next to the bolt holes. Also based on surface pressures, the thickness of
the GFRP has to increase very strongly.
## 7.3.5 Support under an end rib
In this section the occurring stresses will be calculated if a strip of steel (or UHMWPE) is glued
over the entire width of the bridge under an end rib. However, it is the case that not the
entire surface of this strip carries, it is assumed that at the location of the web-rib connection a
surface carries with a semi-circular shape, as shown in figure 7.4:

Figure 7 .4: Support under an end rib
<!-- image -->
This surface is then equal to:
A = 0.5-nb 2
[7.3-12]
Where b is the width of the strip. The width must be of the same order of magnitude as the rib and web
thicknesses (say that the width may be a maximum of 10 times the thickness of the thinnest plate).
<!-- image -->
With the following required surfaces this yields the following strip widths:
- i) A = support 19552 mm 2 b = 112 mm
- ii) A = support 29928 mm 2 b = 138 mm
- iii) A = support 12264 mm 2 b = 88.4 mm
Since the load is introduced directly into the composite structure, an amount of 90° material must be added
to the web plates (and ribs):
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
- i) t 90 o = 3.0 mm
- ii) tw = 3.8 mm
- iii) ro = 2.4 mm 90
where: t go . the required thickness of 90° material (height direction of the web plates)
Due to buckling it is necessary to use a sandwich construction.
It therefore appears to be quite possible to apply a support under an end rib.
## 7.3.6 Comparison and preference
With the aid of a steel fitting, the load is probably introduced more evenly over the height than with a
support under an end rib. However, all these fittings lead to a large number of connections and the risk that
only a few will bear weight is high. When applying a steel fitting, the author prefers to glue the fitting to the
composite construction rather than bolting the fitting.
As far as surface pressures are concerned, it appears to be quite possible to apply a strip under the end rib
as a support. This construction form also has the advantage that the number of connections is
very low. The author therefore prefers this construction form.

## 7.4 Trap Pivots
## 7.4.1 Construction possibilities
There are two principle solutions for the pivot points, one in which the pivot points are not loaded by the
traffic on the bridge and one in which the pivot points are loaded by the traffic. Initially, a number of
constructive solutions will be described and then the dimensioning of the pivot points will begin.
PIVOT POINTS NOT LOADED BY TRAFFIC Figure 7.5 shows two constructions where the pivot points
are not loaded by traffic.
Figure 7.5: Pivot points of the fall that are not loaded by traffic
<!-- image -->
In both cases, the relief of the pivot points in the closed position of the bridge is provided in the following
way. An axle is rotatable in a plastic or bronze block, which is locked in a steel housing with a few millimeters
of play in the vertical direction. When the bridge is lowered from an open position, the pivot points are
fully loaded by the weight of the bridge, then the bearing surfaces of the bridge touch the supports on the quay
and the plastic or bronze block is pushed up slightly in the steel housing and the pivot points are relieved. The
load is now fully carried by the supports of the web plates. With this method of construction, only two or three
pivot points are required. This form of construction is not completely new, but has already been used several
times in the past on drawbridges.
<!-- image -->
Below a brief explanation will be given of the constructions shown in Figure 7.5:
- 1. In the first construction option, a fitting is attached to the web plates using a bolt connection. A bolt connection
is used because the loads are high and because the eccentricity in the fitting would lead to inadmissible
"peel stresses" in a glued seam. The fitting should preferably be applied to both sides of the web plate to
prevent eccentricity. By applying the fitting to both sides, both facings of the sandwich construction are also
clamped (if there is a sandwich construction at the location of the pivot point), which ensures a higher "bearing
strength".

high and because the eccentricity in the fitting would lead to unacceptable "peel stresses" in a glued seam. The
fitting should preferably be applied to both sides of the web plate to prevent eccentricity. By applying the fitting to
both sides, both facings of the sandwich construction are also clamped (if there is a sandwich construction at
the location of the pivot point), which ensures a higher "bearing strength".
Due to the eccentricity in the fitting, the laminate and therefore also the sandwich core (if a sandwich
construction is used) is locally subjected to pressure. This problem can be solved by reducing
the sandwich core to a thickness of 0 for the pivot point, or by using a wooden core at these points
instead of a foam core. Another possibility is to place bushings around the bolts, whereby these bushings
absorb the pressure stresses.
- 2. In the second case, a type of mortise and tenon joint is used, in which an axle is fitted through the web
plates. With this construction form, gusset plates (steel or aluminium plates that are glued to the
construction) can be fitted to prevent buckling and to guide the load evenly over the height. An axle is chosen
that is rigidly connected to the web plates and can rotate in the bronze or plastic housing.
## TURNING POINTS LOADED BY TRAFFIC
Figure 7.6 shows a number of construction options for traffic-loaded pivot points.
Figure 7.6: Pivot points of the fall subject to traffic loads
<!-- image -->
With this construction form there is also the choice of a fitting (possibly also with a mortise and tenon
joint) and a mortise and tenon joint. Since the number of web plates is large, it is obvious to
use an axle across the entire width of the bridge.
However, this does lead to a high bending moment in the shaft and also causes problems when coordinating
the pin-hole connections.
<!-- image -->
Below a brief explanation will be given of the constructions shown in Figure 7.6:
- 1. In the first construction form, a steel plate is attached to each web plate, with an axle passing through this
plate.
- 2. In this construction the axis goes directly through the web plates. The mutual coordination of
pin-hole connections is here even more complicated than in the previous case.
- 3. In this design, there is a fitting on the end rib at each web plate. These fittings are used to
an axis.

The bending moment in an axis across the entire width of the bridge is so great that the
axis would have impossible dimensions. This construction form also leads to many
connections and to problems in the mutual coordination of the mortise and tenon
connections. The author therefore prefers the construction in which the pivot points are not
loaded by traffic. The choice for a fitting or a mortise and tenon connection will be
made after the calculations that follow in the following paragraphs.
## Load and laminate thickness
Two situations are considered:
- i) Only two pivot points, possibly extended to three if necessary.
- ii) Full width pivot points of the fall (for a web spacing of 500 mm (a) and 750 mm (b)).
For full width pivots it is assumed that only 75% of the number of pivots are carrying. The
maximum loads on the pivots are equal to:
| i) | F dr ; max = 132550 N
80865 N | F drv ; max = 108707 N
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------
------|---------------------------------|
| ii a) | F dr ; max = 22092 N

| F drh : max | =

If a fitting is glued to the laminate, the laminate must be able to support the following
loads at the pivot points:
- · The normal force in the longitudinal direction of the bridge/web plates. This load will be
further elaborated below.
- · The shear force in the vertical direction of the bridge/web plates. This load corresponds to the maximum
horizontal load as mentioned above.

The maximum load in the longitudinal direction of the web plates is equal
On:
- i) F lanss = 108707 N iia) F lami 5 =18118N iib) F long
5 = 27177 N
It is assumed that this load is carried by a width of 300 mm. For the given load, the
web plates at the pivot points must consist of (if the thickness is +/-45 less than
necessary for the traffic load, the highest thickness is used):

- i) '45° = 3.5 mm fa- = 1 . 4 mm iia) t'. = 5.3 mm ro, = 0.1 mm iib) r 45 . = 2.2 mm '0° = 0.2 mm
where: t Ai . the required thickness +/- 45° material t . 0 the required thickness 0° material
(longitudinal direction of the web plates)
Given the type of load, no additional dynamic factor will be taken into account.
## 7.4.2 Pivot points with a fitting and bolt connection (not subject to traffic loads)
An additional safety factor of 2 is applied to the load since not every bolt carries an equal part of the load (total
safety factor of 3). The calculations will use formulas [7.3-10] and [7.3-11].
For the given loads the required bolts are:
- i) 2 rows of 3 M12 bolts (5 M12 bolts is in principle sufficient)
- ii) 2 rows of 2 M12 bolts (1 M12 bolt is in principle sufficient)
- iii) 2 rows of 2 M l 2 bolts (2 M l 2 bolts is in principle sufficient)
<!-- image -->
For required thicknesses of the GFRP based on surface pressure and peak stress next to the bolt
holes, the following is followed (assuming a fitting width and height of 300 mm):

where: tb the required thickness in relation to the bearing stress
It is therefore quite possible to use a fitting with bolt connection. Only if only two pivot points are used, a
relatively large amount of material must be added to be able to absorb the bearing pressure.
The required shaft diameter results from the allowable stresses in the shaft and the allowable surface pressure
in the shaft housing. These stresses are discussed in the following paragraphs.
## 7.4.3 Pivot points with a mortise and tenon connection (not subject to traffic loads)
## BEARING STRESS
Here we will calculate with a connection where the axle is fixed in the web plate and rotates in the housing of the
fitting. It is initially assumed that the entire load is absorbed by the laminate and not by any gusset
plates. If we assume that the supporting width is equal to 3 times the axle diameter, then the following results
for the required thicknesses for an axle diameter of 150 mm:

Introducing the load therefore leads to relatively small laminate thicknesses. If the required quantities of 0°, 90°
and +/-45° material are added, the bearing pressure is not decisive.
## SKETCH PLATES
The above calculations show that it is not necessary in principle to apply sketch plates. If sketch plates
were applied, a very small thickness would suffice.
<!-- image -->
## 7.4.4 Surface pressure in the axle housing
If the load permits, UHMWPE is used for the axle housing. This material is both low-friction and wear-
resistant. The contact length between axle and housing is equal to L. If it is assumed that the axle
is in contact with the housing over an angle of 60°, then a contact surface equal to:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The required contact surface area is as follows:
A = r
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

-
[7.4-2]
Where ov is the allowable surface pressure.
If UHMWPE is used for the axle housing for reasons of wear resistance and friction, the following diameter
and length combinations are used:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
iia) d= 100 mm L = 20.3 mm (not real)
- iib) d= 100 mm L = 31.6 mm (not real)
This results in acceptable axle-diameter axle-housing width ratios.
Assuming that the bridge is opened 10 times a day for 2 minutes, this gives an open time of 365,000 minutes
over a period of 50 years. Using formula 7.3-2, this gives a compression of 4% at a surface pressure of 10 Mpa,
which is more than low enough.
<!-- image -->
## 7.4.5 Axle dimensions and bearings
This subject will not be discussed further at this stage. As an indication, a standard version of a pivot point of
the fall of a steel drawbridge is shown below.
Figure 7.7: A standard pivot point of a steel drawbridge
<!-- image -->
## 7.4.6 Comparison and preference
As discussed earlier, preference is given to pivot points that are not subject to traffic loads. The author prefers
the mortise and tenon joint, because this joint does not lead to eccentricities and also leads to very acceptable
material thicknesses. The application of gusset plates appears to be superfluous in principle.
## 7 .5 Rack and drop rod connection
In this chapter, several constructive solutions for the rack-fall and suspension rod-fall connection are studied.
The design of these pivot points still depends on whether or not side beams are used (see paragraph 7.6). If
side beams are used, there is a choice to attach the rack rods to these side beams or to do this directly to the
fall. The best solution depends, among other things, on the construction of the fall. The importance of the side
beams will be discussed in more detail in paragraph 7.6. If the rack is attached directly to the fall, there
must be sufficient space between these side beams and the fall when using side beams. The
biggest advantage of attaching the rack rods to the side beams is the fact that the entire fall is then free of
pivot points (with the exception of the pivot points of the fall itself).
<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->
<!-- image -->
The maximum rack force is equal to 152100 N. No additional dynamic factor needs to be taken into account for
this load as it is already included in the wind load. The maximum suspension rod force depends on the chosen
balance pin shape. For the two shapes studied the maximum suspension rod force is equal to 60990 N and
80162 N. A dynamic factor of 1.25 must be applied to this suspension rod force which results in a load of 76238
N and 100203 N.
## 7.5.1 Constructive solutions
The constructive solutions discussed here are shown in Figure 7.8. The aim is
to achieve a constructive solution in which the load is introduced as evenly
and symmetrically as possible.
- 1. In this construction, an axle is used through the two web plates of the side beams.
Using a kind of tuning fork, the axle and rack/hanging rod are connected to each
other. In order to ensure that no buckling phenomena occur and to ensure that a large
part of the web plates bears, sketch plates have been applied.
- 2. In this construction, two steel or aluminium plates are attached to the outside of the
two web plates. The plates protrude at the top of the web plates and an axle is fitted
through these plates at that location.
- 3. In this construction solution, a fitting is attached to the top of the side beam. This
fitting is attached with a bolt connection to tension fittings, which are connected
to the web plates of the side beam and to two ribs in the side beam at that location.
- 4. In this case, a fitting is attached to the side of the side beam. The main disadvantage of
this is that the construction is subjected to a strong asymmetrical load, which leads to
stresses perpendicular to the side wall of the side beams. This construction form (and
also the following construction form) can also be used if the suspension rods/rack rods
are attached directly to the halyard.
- 5. In this construction, an axis is applied asymmetrically through two web plates.
However, the asymmetry does not lead to stresses perpendicular to the side walls/web
plates, since the axis passes through both web plates. Here, again, gusset plates are
applied to prevent buckling phenomena and to introduce the load as evenly as possible.
In modified form, constructions 2 to 3 are also applicable if the rack/hanging rods
are attached to the fall. An example of this is shown in figure 7.9.

The construction studied here corresponds to the constructive solutions 1 to 3 as described above. For the
bearing stress follows:

The nominal voltage follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The peak voltage at the hole is as follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The required amount of +/- 45° material in connection with shear is as follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
If this stress concentration factor is assumed to be the same as for metals (not entirely correct), then this factor is
equal to 3. It is further assumed that the supporting width is equal to three times the diameter of the shaft. A safety
factor of 3.0 is used for the stress in the laminate and a safety factor of 1.5 for the bearing pressure (whereby
the maximum permissible bearing pressure is equal to 150 Mpa). The required thicknesses for the bearing
pressure (/ ) and for the peak stress (r ») around the hole are as follows: b 90

Apart from stability, this therefore provides acceptable thicknesses and the application of sketch plates is in
principle unnecessary. If the required amount of +/-45 0 material and 90° material is applied, the surface
pressure is not decisive and the shaft diameter can decrease in terms of surface pressure. In principle,
a quantity of 0° material must also be added, but this quantity has been neglected.

## 7.5.3 Axis loaded asymmetrically by two web plates

axis as used in a design in steel, with an equal load. A web plate distance of 750 mm will be used for the fall.

Apart from stability, this provides acceptable thicknesses and the application of sketch plates is
also in this case in principle unnecessary. If the required amount of 90° material and +/-
45° material is applied, the required thickness in connection with the bearing pressure is also
met. In principle, a quantity of 0° material must also be added, but this quantity has been
neglected for the time being.
## 7.5.4 Fitting with bolts
In this paragraph the number of bolts is calculated for the case where an asymmetrically
applied bolt connection is used (for example the fourth construction form in figure 7.8).
Eccentricities, i.e. normal stresses in the bolts, are not yet taken into account.
<!-- image -->
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
For the nominal and peak voltage:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: r is the number of rows of bolts
For the given loads the required bolts are:
- i) 2 rows of 3 M l 6 bolts (5 M l 2 bolts is in principle sufficient)
- ii) 2 rows of 3 M12 bolts (1 M12 bolt is in principle sufficient)
- iii) 2 rows of 2 M l 6 bolts (or 2 rows of 4 M l 2 bolts)
at bm = 250 mm this gives the following results:
Table 7.5: Required thicknesses for the suspension rod and rack-and-drop connection

| hanging rod 1 | 21.2 | 7.9 | 2 |
| hanging rod2 | 31.3 | 10.8 | 2.7 |
Therefore, a relatively large amount of material must be added to absorb the surface pressure. In
principle, a quantity of 0° material must also be added, but this quantity has been neglected for the time being.

## 7.5.5 Bonded steel plates for load introduction
This section will discuss the application of steel gusset plates for introducing the load. In
this case, the load is introduced into both the steel and the composite, but given the
considerably greater stiffness of steel, the load is mainly absorbed by the gusset plates.
The load in the gusset plates is then transferred to the composite structure via
a glued seam. Another possibility is to introduce the load into a steel plate only, after
which the load is then transferred to the composite via a glued seam.
In this section the outer web plate of an asymmetric rack-and-drop connection will be
studied.
<!-- image -->
For the stresses in the composite and steel plate the following follows:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
The following approximately applies to the normal forces/bearing pressure:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
where: F is the axle load
D the axle load d the diameter of the axle
The shear flow that must be passed through the bond line is equal to the shear
flow in the aluminum plate. The thickness of the aluminum plate must be chosen such
that the bearing pressure is low enough, but not thicker as this only leads to a higher load
on the bond line.
Assuming that the load is introduced entirely via the steel plate, the required thickness
of the steel plate is 10.3 mm, whereby the peak stress next to the hole is critical and not
the bearing pressure (where an additional factor of 1.33 has been taken into account in
connection with fatigue). Assuming a 5.4 mm +/-45° GFRP plate, the following applies
for the stress in the steel and composite plate:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
This results in a load on the bondline of 212.4 N/mm. Since this is in fact a uniformly
distributed load across the width of the panel, it is difficult to make an analytical estimate of
the shear stresses in the bondline. However, based on previous calculations on bondlines,
it seems possible to apply a glued joint.

## 7.5.7 Storage
Designing the bearing is beyond the scope of this report. As an example, two
standard steel pivots are included below:
Figure 7.10: Standard design of steel suspension rod and rack connections
<!-- image -->
## 7.5.8 Comparison and preference
If side beams are used, preference is given to a construction for both the suspension rods
and the rack rods in which the load is introduced symmetrically, with an axis being
fitted through the web plates (for example the second construction option in Figure 7.8).
If the suspension rods and rack rods are attached directly to the halyard, the author
prefers an axle fitted through the first two web plates of the halyard (the fifth construction
option in Figure 7.8).
## 7.6 Sidebars
## 7.6.1 Why sidebars and what are the pros and cons?
Since stiffness rather than strength is the determining factor when designing in
fibre-reinforced plastics, it is advisable to adapt the shape of the balance prongs
accordingly. Shortening the balance prongs results in higher bending stiffness,
proportional to the length to the third power. However, the load increases when the length
is shortened, but only proportional to the length to the first power. Shortening the balance
prong therefore results in a considerably lighter balance prong. However, the pivot
point of the bridge and the suspension rods shift towards the centre of the bridge (in
connection with opening the bridge, these must be in a special place in relation to the
pivot points). This may cause
<!-- image -->
unacceptable vibration phenomena. These vibration phenomena can be solved by attaching
the suspension rods to side beams that are attached to the fall at the ends of
the fall.
The application of side beams is only advantageous if it leads to lower costs. The
"snowball effect" must also be taken into account; by making the balance prongs lighter,
the hamei styles can also become lighter.

Using sidebars has a number of advantages as well as disadvantages. Let's start with the advantages:
- · No vibration problems.
- · Shorter and lighter balance point and therefore lighter hammer style.
- · Possibility to attach a suspension rod and rack if this is not possible on the fall, for example in the case
of a full sandwich construction.
- · The side beams can serve as a buffer in the event of collisions.
## Disadvantage:
- · Introduction of two additional pivot points.
If side beams are used, there is still the choice of only attaching the suspension rods to these beams or
also doing this with the rack rods. The advantage of attaching the racks to the side beams is the fact that
almost all pivot points are attached to the side beams. The disadvantage, however, is that the side
beams and the pivot points of the side beams are subjected to greater loads. If the rack is not
attached to the side beams but to the halyard, there must be sufficient space between the side beams and the
halyard to allow the rack rods to be detached.
In the following paragraph, only a few aspects of sidebars will be briefly discussed. If the following
graduation assignment shows that problems really do arise if sidebars are not used, this topic will be
discussed further.
## 7.6.2 Sidebar pivot points
At the ends of the fall, the side beams are attached to the fall. The fall must be able to rotate relative to the
side beams and the attachment is therefore in the form of pivot points. The load on these pivot points depends
largely on whether or not the racks are attached to the side beams.
<!-- image -->
## CONSTRUCTIVE POSSIBILITIES
There are two principle solutions, both of which are shown in Figure 7.11.
Figure 7.11: Sidebar pivot points
<!-- image -->
In the first case, a fitting is used, which is attached to the outer web plate of the fall. In the second
constructive solution, an axis is used through the first two (or three) web plates of the fall. In this case, sketch
plates may be used to prevent buckling phenomena and to obtain the most uniform possible introduction of
forces. The preference of the writer goes out to the second constructive solution, since this solution
does not lead to strongly asymmetric loads, which lead to normal stresses perpendicular

In the first case, a fitting is used, which is attached to the outer web plate of the fall. In the second constructive
solution, an axis is used through the first two (or three) web plates of the fall. In this case, sketch plates may be
used to prevent buckling phenomena and to obtain the most uniform possible introduction of forces. The
preference of the writer goes to the second constructive solution, since this solution does not lead to
strongly asymmetric loads, which lead to normal stresses perpendicular to the plane of the web plates.
## ONLY HANGING RODS ON THE SIDE BEAMS
Assuming that the suspension bar attachment is 12.5 metres from the pivot point of the fall (shape 2 of the
balance prongs), this gives for the most heavily loaded pivot point:
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->
This therefore results in a relatively low load of approximately 60% of the suspension rod load.
BOTH HANGING RODS AND RACK RODS ATTACHED TO THE SIDE BEAMS:
This produces a pivot point that is maximally loaded by a force:
11 3370 NF pivot point
The load is therefore approximately 75% of the rack load.
Based on previous calculations, it appears that designing the pivot points of the side beams is not a problem.

## 8. Conclusions and recommendations
The conclusions regarding the design of the fall of a fiber reinforced plastic drawbridge will be listed here
point by point:
- · The design of a fibre-reinforced plastic fall of a drawbridge appears to be structurally feasible. Both
the studied multi-girder construction and the sandwich construction are structurally feasible.
- · In a multi-girder construction, a box-shaped road surface provides lower costs and weights than a road
surface constructed as a double sandwich construction. However, with this box-
shaped road surface, a proper solution must still be found for absorbing braking loads.
- · The lightest and most cost-effective main structure can be obtained by using GFRP web plates in combination
with CFRP purlins using an epoxy (or vinyl ester) as matrix material.
- · In the multi-girder construction, the two web plate distances studied appear to yield approximately
equal costs and weights of the main construction.

- · In the case of a multi-girder construction, the transverse stiffness provided by the road surface appears to be
insufficient and cross-girders must therefore be installed (these are also necessary at the suspension rods
and rack rods).
- · The sandwich construction provides lower costs than the multi-girder construction but a higher weight. In
connection with inspectability and maintenance, the author prefers the multi-girder construction.
- · The weight of the multi-girder construction is more than a factor of 3 lower than the weight of a steel fall, while
the costs are a factor of 1.2 lower.
- · The fall is supported on UHMWPE support surfaces over the entire width. It is possible to glue steel
fittings to the structure to introduce the load, but the author prefers to apply support surfaces under an end rib,
whereby the force is introduced directly into the composite.
- · The author prefers to use pivot points of the fall that are not subject to traffic loads, using a mortise and
tenon joint (an axle is fitted through the web plates). These joints result in acceptable laminate thicknesses.
- · Both the suspension rod and rack-and-drop connections result in acceptable material thicknesses
and for both connections a mortise and tenon connection is preferred.
- · The use of side beams to which the suspension rods are attached (and possibly also the rack
rods) is structurally possible, but further research will have to show whether it is indeed necessary to
use side beams.
<!-- image -->
The following recommendations are specifically aimed at conducting further research:
- Performing more precise calculations such as finite element calculations.
- · Further research into the construction of the road surface.
- · Further optimizing the construction of the trap.
- · Investigate alternative methods to solve buckling phenomena.
- · Investigating temperature influences, creep, etc.
- · Further study of aspects relating to maintenance, repair and fatigue.

## Appendix A Requirements for strength and loads
The requirements discussed here are derived from the regulations NEN 1008 and NEN 6786
(Lit. 5 and Lit. 6).
## All Tax Class
The bridge studied is a load class 60 traffic bridge. This means that the bridge must be able to carry a load
resulting from two trucks standing next to each other, in combination with an evenly distributed load of 4000 N/
m". Although the traffic lanes must indeed be designed for this load class 60, load class 30 can
be used to design the footpaths and cycle paths.
If more than one lane can be loaded by vehicles, only a maximum of two vehicles (together with the evenly
distributed load) need be taken into account that are present on the bridge. In this case, the total load
combination need only be taken into account for 80%.
## A-2 Position of the load in the longitudinal direction of the bridge
- · Concentrated loads together with the evenly distributed load must be placed in the most unfavourable
position for the bridge section to be calculated.

- · If an influence line has both positive and negative sections, it must be assumed for bridges for
normal traffic that the traffic load is present either only on the positive or only on the negative
sections.
## A-3 Position of the load in the transverse direction
- · The loads must be placed in the most unfavourable position in the transverse direction of
the bridge for the construction part in question; the longitudinal axis of the carriages
remains parallel to the axis of the bridge.
- · For the calculation of the main beams, the load must also be placed in the most
unfavourable position; however, it may be assumed that the vehicle is driving in the middle of
the lane.
- · In the case of bridges with paths extended on both sides, which are loaded
exclusively by bicycles or pedestrians, the calculation of the main girders does not have to
take into account the possibility that one extension is loaded and the other is not,
unless this unilateral loading has a major influence on the main girders.
<!-- image -->
## A-4 Load and impact coefficient
The mobile load must be multiplied by a load and an impact coefficient. In the
following formulas, L is the length in meters over which the mobile load must be applied in order
to obtain the most unfavorable bending moment for the part of the bridge in question.
To simplify it, it can be stated that for L:
- · For beams supported at two points, L is the span length of the
beam under consideration.
- For cross beams and for components that absorb the mobile load of the cross beams, L is the
length of two longitudinal beams.
## Tax coefficient:
The load coefficient takes into account that it is unlikely that the mobile load is at its maximum
over the entire length for longer bridges. This factor is therefore independent of the type
of bridge and/or material used. The following formula is therefore used for the load coefficient:
5 = 0.6 + 40/(100+1)
where: L is the length of the trap
## Impact coefficient:
The impact coefficient takes into account the stress-increasing effect of impacts and/or
vibrations. This factor is dependent on the share of the mobile load on the total load of the
bridge. The smaller the share of the mobile load (smaller span) the smaller the impact
factor. In the VOSB the impact coefficient is formulated as:

The impact coefficient takes into account the stress-increasing effect of impacts and/or
vibrations. This factor is dependent on the share of the mobile load on the total load of the
bridge. The smaller the share of the mobile load (smaller span) the smaller the impact
factor. In the VOSB the impact coefficient is formulated as:
5= 1+40/(100+1)
## A -5 Temperature load
Article 7.10 of the VOSB 1988 was used as a starting point for the temperature profile to be
maintained across the bridge. The question is to what extent this is correct, given the
differences in properties between steel and fibre-reinforced plastic.
An attempt will be made to make the assumed temperature load plausible on the
basis of some physical parameters of steel and plastics, which determine the heat transport
in and to the material.
<!-- image -->
The temperature profile in the construction is determined, in addition to external factors,
by the following three material-dependent factors:
- 1. Thermal conductivity coefficient:
This coefficient is a measure of the heat distribution through a material:
steel:
52
J/msK
VVK:
0.15-0.40
J/msK
## 2. Specific heat:
This quantity indicates how much energy is required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of
material by 1 °C:
steel:
530
J/kgK

VVK:
900-2400
J/kgK
However, it should be noted that the density of fiber reinforced plastics
(1500-2000 kg/m ) is significantly lower than that of steel (7850 kg/m ).
3 3 It is assumed that, with an unchanged external surface area of the bridge, the weight of the bridge made of
plastic is lower (up to 50%) than the weight of a bridge made of steel.
The product of the specific mass and the mass of the bridge is a measure for the ratio between the temperatures
that may occur in a bridge made of steel and plastic respectively, with the external factors remaining the same.
This product amounts to approximately 530* 1.0=530 J/K for a steel bridge and 900*0.33=300 J/K to
2400*0.5=1200 J/K for a plastic bridge.
## 3. Heat transfer coefficient:
This coefficient is a measure of the ease with which heat is transferred from the environment to the structure.
This transfer can occur via radiation, convection and conduction.
The share of conduction is often negligibly small, while convection is mainly determined by external factors.
The share of radiation, on the other hand, is mainly determined by the material itself. The amount of heat
absorbed by a material is expressed in the absorption coefficient. This coefficient is the ratio
between the radiation number C of a material and the radiation number of a "black body".
A "black body" absorbs all the radiation that falls on it. The larger the absorption coefficient, the more heat the
material will absorb.
steel
: 0.24-0.44
plastic:
&gt; ?
## 4. Expansion coefficient:
This coefficient indicates the strain as a function of a temperature difference.
steel:

12. 10* PC
plastic: 4.8.10" /°C (this value applies to E-glass, for aramid and 6 carbon this coefficient can even
be negative)
<!-- image -->
Based on the above, the following assumptions are made:
- · Based on the fact that the product of specific heat and mass for a plastic bridge is almost equal
to that of a steel bridge, the global temperature gradient AT has been roughly the same value
as for a steel bridge in accordance with VOSB 1988 article 7.10, i.e. a temperature change of +35
°C or -35 °C based on an average temperature of +10 °C.
- · Due to the lower thermal conductivity of plastics compared to steel, account must be taken of the occurrence
of higher local temperatures, i.e. a higher gradient across the structure.
The same value is used for the local temperature gradient as for the global
temperature change; i.e. +35 °C linearly varying over the height (AT local: venical) or width (AT
local; honzomail J) of the structure, respectively.
Based on the relationship between the thermal conductivity coefficients of steel and plastic respectively,
higher local temperatures are obvious.
## A-6 Wind load
The load due to wind is 1500 N/m" on the surface affected by the wind. The affected surface is
defined as:
height of the total road surface construction with the traffic band (2.5 m), plus the projections of
the parts of the first main girder protruding below and above it, increased by the area
of the second, third and subsequent main girders calculated in the same way, multiplied by
coefficients of 2/3, (2/3) etc. 2 In addition, a wind force in the longitudinal direction of the bridge
must be taken into account, which occurs simultaneously with an equal wind force in the
transverse direction of the bridge, whereby both forces amount to 40% of the total wind
force perpendicular to the bridge as described above.
## A-7 Braking forces
200 kN acting in the centre of the most unfavourable carriageway for the
construction part under consideration.
<!-- image -->
## A-8 Tax combinations

The following tax combinations must be taken into account:
- Yf;g liegen ^ Y f ; q qmob,el + Yf mobile
- + + Yf; g Qown Yf: q Qmobile Yf ;q mobile
'
- + + Yf; g lie Yf; q Imobile Yf k + v ; q 1 mobile I f; q
*AT, global + Yf local
- Yf:g *q, + Yf ;q *1mobile + Yf ;q 1 1 mobile + Y frem
- *own #Qwind
The coefficients yfg and Y f ; q will be described later.
Any additional loads due to creep and/or shrinkage effects must be
superimposed on the above load combinations.
## A-9 Impositions
Horizontal load of the support
The most unfavourable of the following cases must be taken as the determining load
of the bridge's own weight, the temperature effect, the wind load and the mobile load:
- a. maximum racing power
- b. maximum friction force
- c. brake and friction force together, multiplied by 0.75
- d. wind load
- e. combination of d with a or b or c. (permissible voltage must be increased by 25%)
resistance of movable supports:
roller support: 3% of the support pressure
sliding support: 20% of the support pressure
## A-10 Horizontal forces on components
- · 1000 kN at 1.20 above the top of the platform parallel to the longitudinal axis.
- · 500 kN at 1.20 above the top of the carriageway perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.
